== Configuring Nexus for SSL

Using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) communication within Nexus is an important security feature and a recommended best
practice. Secure communication can be inbound or outbound.

Outbound client communication may include integration with 

* a remote proxy repository over HTTPS, 
* SSL/TLS secured servers (e.g. for SMTP/email integration)
* LDAP servers configured to use LDAPS
* specialized authentication realms such as the Crowd realm.

Inbound client communication includes 

* web browser HTTPS access to the user interface 
* tool access to repository content 
* and manual or scripted usage of the REST APIs.

=== Managing Outbound SSL Certificates

==== Trusting SSL Certificates of Remote Repositories

When the SSL certificate of a remote proxy repository is not trusted, the repository may be automatically blocked or
outbound requests fail with a message similar to 'PKIX path building failed'.

Nexus includes a specific 'SSL' configuration tab for each repository in the repository configuration documented in
<<confignx-sect-manage-repo>> to solve this problem. It is displayed when the remote URL of a proxy repository resolves
to an `https://` location.

The 'SSL' tab shows the details of the remote certificate, as in the example <<fig-ssl-secure-central>>. Use the 'SSL'
tab when the remote certificate is not issued by a well-known public certificate authority included in the default Java
trust store. This specifically also included usage of self-signed certificates used in your organization.

To confirm trust of the remote certificate, click the 'Add to trust store' button on the top-right of the 'SSL' tab.
This feature is analogous to going to the <<fig-ssl-certificates-list>> user interface and using the 'Add' button found
there. If the certificate is already added, the button can undo this operation and will read 'Remove from trust store'.

The checkbox labelled 'Use Nexus SSL trust store' is used to confirm that Nexus should consult the Nexus-private,
internal truststore when confirming trust of the remote repository certificate. Without adding the certificate to the
private truststore and enabling the checkbox, the repository will not trust the remote.

The default JVM truststore of the JVM installation used to run Nexus and the private Nexus truststores are merged. The
result of this merge is used to decide about the trust of the remote server. The default Java truststore already
contains public certificate authority trust certificates. If the remote certificate is signed by one of these
authorities, then explicitly trusting the remote certificate will not be needed.

WARNING: When removing a remote trusted certificate from the truststore, a Nexus restart is required before a repository
may become untrusted.

==== Trusting SSL Certificates Globally

{pro} allows you to manage trust of all remote SSL certificates in a centralized user interface. Use this interface when
you wish to examine all the currently trusted certificates for remote repositories, or manage certificates from secure
remotes that are not repositories.

Access <<fig-ssl-certificates-list>> by selecting 'SSL Certificates' in the left-hand 'Administration' menu. The list
shows any certificates that are already trusted.

[[fig-ssl-certificates-list]]
.SSL Certificates Administration
image::figs/web/ssl-certificates-list.png[scale=50]

Buttons are provided to 'Refresh' the list from the server, 'Add' a new certificate or 'Delete' the selected certificate.

The 'Add' button presents two options - 'Paste PEM' and 'Load from server'.

There are two types of secure addresses supported by the 'Load from server' option.

The common approach is to choose 'Load from server' and enter the full +https://+ url of the remote site, e.g,
`https://repo1.maven.org`. Nexus will connect using HTTPS and use the HTTP proxy server settings if applicable. Any
other protocol than +https://+ is ignored, and a direct socket connection is attempted in that case.

When the remote is not accessible using +https://+, only enter the host name or IP address, optionally followed by colon
and the port number. For example: +example.com:8443+ . In this case Nexus will attempt a direct SSL socket connection to
the remote host at the specified port.

Alternatively you can choose the 'Paste PEM' option to configure trust of a remote certificate. Copy and paste the
Base64 encoded X.509 DER certificate to trust. This text must be enclosed between lines containing +-----BEGIN
CERTIFICATE-----+ and +-----END CERTIFICATE-----+ .

An example method to get the encoded X.509 certificate into a file on the command line using +keytool+ is:

----
keytool -printcert -rfc -sslserver repo1.maven.org > repo1.pem
----

The resulting `repo1.pem` file will contain the encoded certificate text that you can cut and paste into the dialog in
Nexus. An example of inserting such a certificate is shown in <<fig-ssl-pem>>.

[[fig-ssl-pem]]

If Nexus can successfully retrieve the remote certificate or decode the pasted certificate, the details will be shown in
a dialog allowing you to confirm details as shown in <<fig-ssl-add-server>>. Please review the displayed information
carefully before clicking 'Add Certificate' to establish the trust store addition.

In some organizations, all of the remote sites are accessed through a globally configured proxy server which rewrites
every SSL certificate. This single proxy server is acting as a private certificate authority. In this case, you can
https://support.sonatype.com/entries/83303437[follow special instructions for trusting the proxy server root
certificate], which can greatly simplify your certificate management duties.

==== Trusting SSL Certificates Using Keytool

Managing trusted SSL certificates from the command line using
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/index.html#security[keytool] and system properties is an
alternative and more complex option than using the SSL certificate management features of Nexus.

Before you begin the process of trusting a certificate from the command line you will need:

* a basic understanding of http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html[SSL
  certificate technology and how the Java VM implements this feature]

* command line access to the Nexus host operating system and the 'keytool' program

* network access to the remote SSL server you want to trust from the host running Nexus. This must include any HTTP
  proxy server connection details

If you are connecting to servers which have certificates that are not signed by a public CA, you will need to complete
these steps:

. Copy the default JVM truststore file (`$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts`) to a Nexus specific location for editing.

. Import additional trusted certificates into the copied truststore file.

. Configure JSSE system properties for the Nexus process so that the custom truststore is consulted instead of the
  default file.

Some common commands to manually trust remote certificates can be found in our
https://sonatype.zendesk.com/entries/95353268-SSL-Certificate-Guide#common-keytool-commands[SSL Certificate Guide].

===== Configuring Nexus With a Custom Truststore

Once you have imported your trusted certificates into a truststore file, you can modify
'$NEXUS_HOME/bin/jsw/conf/wrapper.conf' to set the system properties necessary to load this file. Make sure to adapt the
property numbers (10, 11) to start at the last unused value, which depends on the rest of your configuration.

----
wrapper.java.additional.10=-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=<truststore>
wrapper.java.additional.11=-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<truststore_password>
----

Once you have added the properties shown above, restart Nexus and attempt to proxy a remote repository using the
imported certificated. Nexus will automatically register the certificates in the truststore file as trusted.

=== Configuring Nexus Inbound HTTPS

Providing access to the Nexus user interface and content via HTTPS is a recommended best practice for any deployment.

You have two options:

* Using a separate reverse proxy server in front of Nexus to manage HTTPS 
* Configure Nexus to serve HTTPS directly

.Using A Reverse Proxy Server

A common approach is to access Nexus through a dedicated server which answers HTTPS requests on behalf of Nexus - these
servers are called reverse proxies or SSL/TLS terminators. Subsequently requests are forwarded to Nexus via HTTP and
responses received via HTTP are then sent back to the requestor via HTTPS.

There are a few advantages to using these which can be discussed with your networking team. For example, Nexus can be
upgraded/installed without the need to work with a custom JVM keystore. The reverse proxy could already be in place for
other systems in your network. Common reverse proxy choices are Apache httpd, nginx, Eclipse Jetty or even dedicated
hardware appliances. All of them can be configured to serve SSL content, and there is a large amount of reference
material available online.

.Nexus Serving SSL Directly

We will elaborate here on the second approach, which is to use the Eclipse Jetty instance that is distributed with Nexus
to accept HTTPS connections.

TIP: Keep in mind that you will have to redo some of these configurations each time you upgrade Nexus, since they are
modifications to the embedded Jetty instance located in '$NEXUS_HOME'.

To configure the Nexus Eclipse Jetty instance to accept HTTPS connections, first enable the file +jetty-https.xml+ to the
Jetty startup configuration in +wrapper.conf+ as detailed in <<nexus-home-conf>>.

Next, the HTTP port you want to use for the HTTPS connection has to be defined by setting the +application-port-ssl+
property in +nexus.properties+.

----
application-port-ssl=8443
----

Create a keystore file containing a single certificate that Jetty will use for the HTTPS connections. Instructions are
available on the http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/current/configuring-ssl.html[Eclipse Jetty documentation
site]. You may find the common keytool commands in our SSL Certiicate Guide a useful reference.

Adjust the values in the +jetty-https.xml+ file in +NEXUS_HOME/conf+ to reflect your keystore settings. The default
configuration in that file suggests to create a subdirectory +NEXUS_HOME/conf/ssl+ and copy the +keystore+ file in there
and rename it to +keystore.jks+. You can either do that or choose a different location or filename for your keystore
file and update the paths for the +keystore+ and +truststore+ in the +jetty-https.xml+ file.

Once this is all in place you can start up Nexus and access the user interface at e.g., +https://localhost:8443/nexus+.
If you have just created a self-signed certificate, modern web browsers will warn you about the certificate and you will
have to acknowledge the fact that the certificate is self-signed. To avoid this behavior, you have to get a certificate
signed by a signing authority or reconfigure the web browser.

Nexus is now available via HTTPS. If desired you can configure automatic redirection from HTTP to HTTPS by adding usage
of +jetty-http-redirect-to-https.xml+ as additional app parameters in +wrapper.conf+ as well as update the `Base URL` in
your Nexus server configuration.
