== Managing Maven Settings

[[settings-sect-intro]]
=== Introduction

When you move an organization to a repository manager such as Nexus,
one of the constant challenges is keeping everyone's Maven Settings
synchronized to ensure the Nexus server is used and any further
configuration in the settings file is consistent.  In additions
different users or use cases require different settings files. You can
find out more about the Maven settings file in <<config>>.  Nexus
Professional allows you to define templates for Maven Settings stored
on the server and provide them to users via the user interface or
automated download.

If a Nexus administrator makes a change which requires every developer
to modify his or her +~/.m2/settings.xml+ file, this feature can be
used to manage the distribution of Maven Settings changes to the
entire organization. Once you have defined a Maven Settings template
in Nexus Professional, developers can then use the Nexus M2Settings
Maven Plugin to retrieve the new Maven settings file directly from
Nexus Professional.

=== Manage Maven Settings Templates

To manage Maven Settings templates, click on 'Maven Settings' in the
'Enterprise' section of the Nexus menu on the left side of the Nexus
UI. This will load the panel shown in <<fig-settings-maven-settings>>.

The Maven Settings panel allows you to add, delete, and edit Maven
Settings templates. The default template has an id of "default" and
can not be changed. It contains the recommended settings for a
standard Nexus installation. To create a new Maven Settings template,
click on the 'Add...' button and select 'Settings Template'. Once the
new template is created, assign a name to the template in the
'Template ID' text input and click the 'Save' button.

To edit a template, click on a template that has a User Managed value
of +true+ in the list and edit the template in the tab below the
list. Once you are finished editing the template, click 'Save' to save
the template. When editing the template you can insert some property
references that will be replaced on the server with their values at
request time:

baseurl:: the base URL of the Nexus installation

userId:: the user id of the user that is generating a Maven Settings
file from this template

Server side interpolation takes effect even when the download of the
settings template is done with tools like curl. These properties can
be referenced in the settings file using the the syntax +${property}+:

----
<settings>
  <mirrors>
    <mirror>
      <id>nexus</id>
      <mirrorOf>*</mirrorOf>
      <url>${baseurl}/content/groups/public</url>
    </mirror>
...
----

To preview a Maven Settings template, click on the 'Template URL' in
the list. Clicking on this URL loads a dialog window which contains
the Maven Settings file generated from this template. This rendered
view of the Maven Settings template has all variable references
replaced using the current context of the user. This is the result of
running the property replacement on the Nexus server.

The Nexus M2Settings Maven Plugin supports the more powerful and
feature rich, client side replacement of properties using a
+$[property]+ syntax.

Client side properties supported by the Nexus M2Settings Maven Plugin
are

baseurl:: the base URL of the Nexus installation.

userId or username:: the username of the user that is requesting a
Maven Settings file from this template.

password:: the password of the user

userToken:: the formatted user token composed of name code, ':' and
pass code.

userToken.nameCode:: the name code part of the user token

userToken.passCode:: the pass code part of the user token

userToken.encrypted:: the encrypted, formatted user token

userToken.nameCode.encrypted:: the encrypted name code part of the
user token

userToken.passCode.encrypted:: the encrypted pass code part of the
user token

Client side interpolation allows you to fully populate a +<server>+
section with the required properties either with the plain text
username and password,

----
<server>
  <id>nexus</id>
  <username>$[username]</username>
  <password>$[password]</password>
</server>
----

the usertoken equivalent 

----
<server>
  <id>nexus</id>
  <!-- User-token: $[userToken] -->
  <username>$[userToken.nameCode]</username>
  <password>$[userToken.passCode]</password>
</server>
----

or with  
http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html[Maven
master-password encryption] with the master keyword in
+settings-security.xml+:

----
<server>
  <id>nexus-client-side-interp-encrypted</id>
  <!-- User-token: $[userToken.encrypted] -->
  <username>$[userToken.nameCode.encrypted]</username>
  <password>$[userToken.passCode.encrypted]</password>
</server>
----

The usage of the +.encrypted+ keys results in values using the
encrypted value syntax based on the master keyword similar to

----
<server>
  <id>nexus-client-side-interp-encrypted</id>
  <!-- User-token: {2Sn+...} -->
  <username>{3HQg...}</username>
  <password>{fsx2f...}</password>
</server>
----

WARNING: `userToken.*` properties are only expanded to values if the
User Token feature as documented in <<config-sect-usertoken>> is
enabled and configured.

=== Nexus M2Settings Maven Plugin

Once you have defined a set of Maven templates, you can use the Nexus
M2Settings Maven Plugin to distribute changes to the settings file to the
entire organization.

==== Running the Nexus M2Settings Maven Plugin

To invoke a goal of the Nexus M2Settings Maven Plugin, you will
initially have to use a fully qualified groupId and artifactId in
addition to the goal. An example invocation of the +download+ goal is:

----
mvn org.sonatype.plugins:nexus-m2settings-maven-plugin:download
----

In order to be able to use an invocation with the simple plugin prefix
like this
----
mvn nexus-m2settings:download
----
you have to have the appropriate
plugin group +org.sonatype.plugins+ configured in your Maven Settings
file:

----
<settings>
  ...
  <pluginGroups>
    <pluginGroup>org.sonatype.plugins</pluginGroup>
  </pluginGroups>
  ...
----

An initial invocation of the download goal will update your settings
file, with a template from Nexus Professional. The default template in
Nexus Professional adds the +org.sonatype.plugins+ group to the
pluginGroups, so you will not have to do this manually. It is
essential that you make sure that any new, custom templates also
includes this plugin group definition. Otherwise, there is a chance
that a developer could update his or her Maven Settings and lose the
ability to use the Nexus Maven plugin with the short identifier.

TIP: This practice of adding pluginGroups to the settings file is
useful for your own Maven plugins or other plugins that do not use the
default values of +org.apache.maven.plugins+ or +org.codehaus.mojo+ as
well, since it allows the short prefix of a plugin to be used for an
invocation outside a Maven project using the plugin.

The +download+ goal of the Nexus M2Settings Maven Plugin downloads a
Maven Settings file from Nexus Professional and stores it locally. The
default file name for the settings file is the Maven default for the
current user of +~/.m2/settings.xml+ file. If you are replacing a
Maven Settings file, this goal can be configured to make a backup of
an existing Maven Settings file.

NOTE: The download with the Nexus Maven Plugin is deprecated and has
been replaced with the Nexus M2Settings Maven Plugin.


==== Configuring Nexus M2Settings Maven Plugin

The download goal of the Nexus M2Settings Maven plugin prompts the
user for all required parameters, which include the Nexus server URL,
the username and password and the template identifier. 

NOTE: For security reason the settings download requires a HTTPS
 connection to your Nexus instance. If you are running Nexus via plain
 HTTP you will have to set the +secure+ parameter to +false+.

The required configuration parameters can either be supplied
as invocation parameters or when prompted by the plugin and are:

nexusUrl:: points to the Nexus server installation's base URL. If you
have installed Nexus on your local machine, this would be
http://localhost:8081/nexus/. Access via http only works with the
+secure+ configuration parameter set to +false+.

username:: the username to use for authenticating to Nexus. Default
value is the the Java System property +user.name+

password:: password to use for authenticating to Nexus

templateId:: the Template ID for the settings template as defined in
the Nexus user interface 

Additional general configuration parameters are related to the
security of the transfer and the output file:

secure:: by default set to +true+, this parameter forces a Nexus URL
access with HTTPS. Overriding this parameter and setting it to +false+
allows you to download a settings file via HTTP. When using this
override it is important to keep in mind that the username and
password transfered via HTTP can be intercepted.

outputFile:: defines the filename and location of the downloaded file
and defaults to the standard '~/.m2/settings.xml'

backup:: If true and there is a pre-existing settings.xml file in
the way of this download, backup the file to a date-stamped filename,
where the specific format of the date-stamp is given by the
backupTimestampFormat parameter. Default value is +true+. 

backup.timestampFormat:: When backing up an existing settings.xml file,
use this date format in conjunction with SimpleDateFormat to construct
a new filename of the form: settings.xml-$(format). Date stamps are
used for backup copies of the settings.xml to avoid overwriting
previously backed up settings files. This protects against the case
where the download goal is used multiple times with incorrect
settings, where using a single static backup-file name would destroy
the original, pre-existing settings. Default value is: +yyyyMMddHHmmss+.

encoding:: Use this optional parameter to define a non-default
encoding for the settings file.

As a Maven plugin the Nexus M2Settings Maven Plugin relies on Apache
Maven execution and therefore on the fact that the Central Repository
can be contacted for downloading the required plugins and
dependencies. If this access is only available via a proxy server you
can configure the proxy related parameters +proxy+, +proxy.protocol+,
+proxy.host+, +proxy.port+, +proxy.username+ and +proxy.password+.

==== Downloading Maven Settings

You can download the Maven Settings from Nexus Professional with a
simple invocation, and rely on the plugin to prompt you for the
required parameters:

----

----

If your Nexus server is hosted internally and does not use https you can
download a settings file with
----
$ mvn org.sonatype.plugins:nexus-m2settings-maven-plugin:download -Dsecure=false
----

As displayed the plugin will query for all parameters and display a
list of the available templates. Alternatively, you can specify the
username, password, Nexus URL and template identifier on the command
line.

----
$ mvn org.sonatype.plugins:nexus-m2settings-maven-plugin:download \
-DnexusUrl=https://localhost:8443/nexus \
-Dusername=admin \
-Dpassword=admin123 \
-DtemplateId=default
----

Enabling proxy access with +-Dproxy=true+ will trigger the plugin to
query the necessary configuration:

----
[INFO] Connecting to: https://localhost:8443/nexus (as admin)
Proxy Protocol:
   0) http
   1) https
Choose: 1
Proxy Host: myproxy.example.com
Proxy Port: 9000
Proxy Authentication:
   0) yes
   1) no
Choose: 0
Proxy Username [manfred]: proxy
Proxy Password: ******
[INFO] Proxy enabled: proxy@https:myproxy.example.com:9000
----

In some scenarios you have to get an initial settings file installed
on a computer that does not have internet access and can therefore not
use the Maven plugin. For this first initial configuration, that
connects the computer to Nexus for following Maven invocations, a
simple HTTP GET command to retrieve an unmodified settings file can be
used:

----
curl -u admin:admin123 -X GET "http://localhost:8081/nexus/service/local/templates/settings/default/content" > ~/.m2/settings.xml
----

Modify the commandline above by changing the username:password
supplied after -u and adapting the url to Template URL visible in the
Nexus user interface. This invocation will however not do the client
side replacement of parameters, so you will have to manually change
any username or password configuration, if applicable.

=== Summary

Overall the Maven Settings integration in Nexus allows you to maintain
multiple settings template files on the central Nexus server. You can
configure settings files for different use cases like referencing a
repository group containing only approved components in the mirror
section for your release or QA builds, while at the same time
providing an open public group mirror reference to all your developers
for experimentation with other components.

By using the Nexus M2Settings Maven Plugin you can completely automate
initial provisioning and updates of these settings files to your users.
