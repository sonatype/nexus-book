== Managing Maven Settings

{inrmonly}

[[settings-sect-intro]]
=== Introduction

When you move an organization to a repository manager such as {pro} or {oss}, one of the constant challenges is
keeping everyone's Maven settings synchronized to ensure the repository manager server is used and any further
configuration in the settings file is consistent.  In addition, different users or use cases require different
settings files. You can find out more about the Maven settings file in <<config>>. {pro} allows you to define
templates for Maven settings stored on the server and provide them to users via the user interface or automated
download.

If an administrator makes a change that requires every developer to modify his or her +~/.m2/settings.xml+ file,
this feature can be used to manage the distribution of Maven settings changes to the entire organization. Once you
have defined a Maven settings template in {pro}, developers can then use the Nexus M2Settings Maven Plugin to
retrieve the new Maven settings file directly from {pro}.

=== Manage Maven Settings Templates

To manage Maven settings templates, click on 'Maven Settings' in the 'Enterprise' section of the main menu on the
left side of the user interface. This will load the panel shown in <<fig-settings-maven-settings>>.

The Maven Settings panel allows you to add, delete, and edit Maven Settings templates. The default template has an
ID of +default+ and can not be changed. It contains the recommended settings for a standard repository manager
installation. To create a new Maven settings template, click on the 'Add...' button and select 'Settings
Template'. Once the new template is created, assign a name to the template in the 'Template ID' text input and
click the 'Save' button.

To edit a template, click on a template that has a 'User Managed' value
of +true+ in the list and edit the template in the tab below the
list. Once you are finished editing the template, click 'Save' to save
the template. When editing the template you can insert some property
references that will be replaced on the server with their values at
request time:

baseurl:: The base URL of the repository manager installation.

userId:: The user id of the user that is generating a Maven Settings
file from this template.

Server side interpolation takes effect even when the download of the
settings template is done with tools like curl. These properties can 
be referenced in the settings file using the syntax +$\{property\}+:

----
<settings>
  <mirrors>
    <mirror>
      <id>nexus</id>
      <mirrorOf>*</mirrorOf>
      <url>${baseurl}/content/groups/public</url>
    </mirror>
...
----

To preview a Maven settings template, click on the 'Template URL' in the list. Clicking on this URL loads a dialog
window that contains the Maven Settings file generated from this template. This rendered view of the Maven
Settings template has all variable references replaced using the current context of the user. This is the result
of running the property replacement on the repository manager.

The Nexus M2Settings Maven Plugin supports the more powerful and
feature-rich, client-side replacement of properties using a
+$[property]+ syntax.

Client-side properties supported by the Nexus M2Settings Maven Plugin
are

baseurl:: The base URL of the repository manager installation.

userId or username:: The username of the user that is requesting a
Maven Settings file from this template.

password:: The password of the user.

userToken:: The formatted user token composed of name code, ':' and
pass code.

userToken.nameCode:: The name code part of the user token.

userToken.passCode:: The pass code part of the user token.

userToken.passCode.encrypted:: The encrypted pass code part of the
user token.

Client side interpolation allows you to fully populate a +<server>+
section with the required properties either with the plain text
username and password:

----
<server>
  <id>nexus</id>
  <username>$[username]</username>
  <password>$[password]</password>
</server>
----

You can also use the usertoken equivalent: 

----
<server>
  <id>nexus</id>
  <!-- User-token: $[userToken] -->
  <username>$[userToken.nameCode]</username>
  <password>$[userToken.passCode]</password>
</server>
----

Alternatively you can use  
http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html[Maven
master-password encryption] with the master keyword in
+settings-security.xml+:

----
<server>
  <id>nexus-client-side-interp-encrypted</id>
  <!-- Maven master password encrypted user token password -->
  <username>$[userToken.nameCode]</username>
  <password>$[userToken.passCode.encrypted]</password>
</server>
----

The usage of the +.encrypted+ key results in values similar to 
the following snippet:

----
<server>
  <id>nexus-client-side-interp-encrypted</id>
  <!-- master password encrypted user token password -->
  <username>KOYC8Q76</username>
  <password>{fsx2f...}</password>
</server>
----

WARNING: `userToken.*` properties are only expanded to values if the
User Token feature as documented in <<usertoken>> is
enabled and configured.


[[settings-sect-downloading]]
=== Nexus M2Settings Maven Plugin

Once you have defined a set of Maven templates, you can use the Nexus
M2Settings Maven Plugin to distribute changes to the settings file to the
entire organization.

==== Running the Nexus M2Settings Maven Plugin

To invoke a goal of the Nexus M2Settings Maven Plugin, you will
initially have to use a fully qualified groupId and artifactId in
addition to the goal. An example invocation of the +download+ goal is:

----
mvn org.sonatype.plugins:nexus-m2settings-maven-plugin:download
----

In order to be able to use an invocation with the simple plugin prefix
like this
----
mvn nexus-m2settings:download
----
you have to have the appropriate
plugin group +org.sonatype.plugins+ configured in your Maven Settings
file:

----
<settings>
  ...
  <pluginGroups>
    <pluginGroup>org.sonatype.plugins</pluginGroup>
  </pluginGroups>
  ...
----

An initial invocation of the download goal will update your settings file with a template from {pro}. The default
template in {pro} adds the +org.sonatype.plugins+ group to the +pluginGroups+, so you will not have to do this
manually. It is essential that you make sure that any new, custom templates also include this plugin group
definition. Otherwise, there is a chance that a developer could update his or her Maven settings and lose the
ability to use the Nexus M2Settings Maven Plugin with the short identifier.

TIP: This practice of adding pluginGroups to the settings file is
useful for your own Maven plugins or other plugins that do not use the
default values of +org.apache.maven.plugins+ or +org.codehaus.mojo+ as
well, since it allows the short prefix of a plugin to be used for an
invocation outside a Maven project using the plugin.

The +download+ goal of the Nexus M2Settings Maven Plugin downloads a
Maven Settings file from {pro} and stores it locally. The
default file name for the settings file is the Maven default for the
current user of +~/.m2/settings.xml+ file. If you are replacing a
Maven Settings file, this goal can be configured to make a backup of
an existing Maven Settings file.

NOTE: The download with the Nexus Maven Plugin is deprecated and has
been replaced with the Nexus M2Settings Maven Plugin.

==== Configuring Nexus M2Settings Maven Plugin

The download goal of the Nexus M2Settings Maven plugin prompts the
user for all required parameters, which include the server URL,
the username and password, and the template identifier. 

NOTE: For security reasons, the settings download requires an HTTPS connection to your repository manager
 instance. If you are running the repository manager via plain HTTP you will have to set the +secure+ parameter to
 +false+.

The required configuration parameters can either be supplied
as invocation parameters or when prompted by the plugin and are:

nexusUrl:: Points to the repository manager installation's base URL. If you have installed the repository manager
on your local machine, this would be http://localhost:8081/nexus/. Access via HTTP only works with the +secure+
configuration parameter set to +false+.

username:: The username to use for authenticating to the repository manager. Default value is the Java System
property +user.name+.

password:: The password to use for authenticating to the repository manager.

templateId:: The Template ID for the settings template as defined in the user interface.

Additional general configuration parameters are related to the
security of the transfer and the output file:

secure:: By default set to +true+, this parameter forces a URL access with HTTPS. Overriding this parameter and
setting it to +false+ allows you to download a settings file via HTTP. When using this override it is important to
keep in mind that the username and password transfered via HTTP can be intercepted.

outputFile:: Defines the filename and location of the downloaded file
and defaults to the standard +~/.m2/settings.xml+.

backup:: If true and there is a pre-existing settings.xml file in
the way of this download, back up the file to a date-stamped filename,
where the specific format of the datestamp is given by the
backupTimestampFormat parameter. Default value is +true+. 

backup.timestampFormat:: When backing up an existing settings.xml file,
use this date format in conjunction with SimpleDateFormat to construct
a new filename of the form: settings.xml-$(format). Date stamps are
used for backup copies of the settings.xml to avoid overwriting
previously backed up settings files. This protects against the case
where the download goal is used multiple times with incorrect
settings, where using a single static backup file name would destroy
the original, preexisting settings. Default value is: +yyyyMMddHHmmss+.

encoding:: Use this optional parameter to define a non-default
encoding for the settings file.

As a Maven plugin, the Nexus M2Settings Maven Plugin relies on Apache
Maven execution and on the fact that the Central Repository
can be contacted for downloading the required plugins and
dependencies. If this access is only available via a proxy server you
can configure the proxy related parameters +proxy+, +proxy.protocol+,
+proxy.host+, +proxy.port+, +proxy.username+ and +proxy.password+.

==== Downloading Maven Settings

You can download the Maven Settings from {pro} with a
simple invocation, and rely on the plugin to prompt you for the
required parameters:

----

----

If your repository manager is hosted internally and does not use HTTPS you can download a settings file with
----
$ mvn org.sonatype.plugins:nexus-m2settings-maven-plugin:download -Dsecure=false
----

As displayed, the plugin will query for all parameters and display a
list of the available templates. Alternatively, you can specify the
username, password, URL, and template identifier on the command
line.

----
$ mvn org.sonatype.plugins:nexus-m2settings-maven-plugin:download \
-DnexusUrl=https://localhost:8443/nexus \
-Dusername=admin \
-Dpassword=admin123 \
-DtemplateId=default
----

Enabling proxy access with +-Dproxy=true+ will trigger the plugin to
query the necessary configuration:

----
[INFO] Connecting to: https://localhost:8443/nexus (as admin)
Proxy Protocol:
   0) http
   1) https
Choose: 1
Proxy Host: myproxy.example.com
Proxy Port: 9000
Proxy Authentication:
   0) yes
   1) no
Choose: 0
Proxy Username [manfred]: proxy
Proxy Password: ******
[INFO] Proxy enabled: proxy@https:myproxy.example.com:9000
----

In some scenarios you have to get an initial settings file installed on a computer that does not have internet
access and, therefore, cannot use the Maven plugin. For this first initial configuration that connects the
computer to the repository manager for following Maven invocations, a simple HTTP GET command to retrieve an
unmodified settings file can be used:

----
curl -u admin:admin123 -X GET "http://localhost:8081/nexus/service/local/templates/settings/default/content" > ~/.m2/settings.xml
----

Modify the commandline above by changing the username:password supplied after -u and adapting the URL to the URL
visible in the user interface. This invocation will however not replace parameters on the client side, so you will
have to manually change any username or password configuration, if applicable.

=== Summary

Overall the Maven Settings integration in {pro} allows you to maintain multiple settings template files on the
central repository manager. You can configure settings files for different use cases like e.g.,

* referencing a repository group containing only approved components in the mirror section for your release or QA
builds,
* providing an open public group mirror reference to all of your developers for experimentation with other
components.

By using the Nexus M2Settings Maven Plugin you can completely automate initial provisioning and updates of these
settings files to your users.
