==  Backing Up and Restoring {nxrm}
{inall}

[[backup-introduction]]
=== Introduction

{nxrm} lets you utilize a scheduled task to aid with backing up your repository manager. Along with your backup
procedure you can configure your repository manager to save the OrientDB databases that store your component
metadata and system configurations.

You can configure this task to export settings and metadata from the underlying OrientDB databases. When running
the task it:

* stores the databases to a new location when configured.
* generates a snapshot of the databases for you to back up, along with the other parts of the repository manager.
* suspends access to the database until the backup is complete.

It is recommended you develop a backup procedure and provide a backup location for your {nxrm}. Finally, you must
synchronize the database exports with other parts of the repository manager that you wish to back up.

This chapter shows you how to configure and execute the tasks as well as to learn how to and recover the exported
databases of your {nxrm}. 

[[backup-preparation]]
=== Preparing a Backup for {nxrm}

The databases that you export have pointers to blob stores, which reside in the data directory and contain components
and assets potentially across multiple repositories. If you don't back them up together the component metadata
can point to non-existent blob stores, or the blob store metadata may be non-descript when attempting to restore
the exported data. So, your backup strategy should involve copying both your databases and blob stores together to
a new location, in order to keep the data intact.

Here's a common scenario for backing up custom configurations in tandem with the database export task:

1. Configure the 'Export configuration & metadata for backup' task to export databases.
2. Run the scheduled task to export the databases to the configured folder.
3. Back up custom configurations in your installation and data directories around the same time you run the
export task.
4. Back up all blob stores.
5. Store all backed up configurations and exported data together.

NOTE: Write access to databases is temporarily suspended until a backup is complete. It's advised to schedule
backup tasks during off-hours.

[[backup-task]]
=== Configuring and Running an 'Export configuration & metadata for backup' Task

To configure and run a new task for database backup, review the steps in the Configuration chapter. The form
for this task includes an additional field called 'Backup location', which requires you to enter the path to a
directory where you want to store backup data, shown in <<fig-backup-task>>.

When the task runs it exports backup data to the path specified in the 'Backup location' field. The directory
you input will contain +.bak+ files of the following databases:

Access log:: login and usage information among repository manager users 
Analytics:: event data and overall repository manager usage
Auditing:: a record of repository manager configuration changes as well as asset or component additions and
removals
Component:: all related data that make up components within the repository manager 
Configuration:: general adminstrative configurations such as scheduled tasks, email server configuration, etc.
Security:: all user and access rights management content

All backup files are presented in the timestamp format based on the time the task was started. 

After you complete the database export and store the files in a secure location, you can restore the exported
files.


[[backup-restore]]
=== Restoring Exported Databases

////
IMPORTANT:: The restoration process should be executed on a single node.  All nodes in an high availability cluster
should be stopped prior to restoration.
////

You can restore the exported database files to the state when you ran the scheduled task. This requires you to:

* access the location specified in the `Backup location` field from the 'Export configuration & metadata for
backup' task where the database were exported.
* remove the database directories you want to restore, but only the ones you want restored to a new state.

The restoration will not overwrite the existing data of database left in place.

Start the database restoration with these steps:

1. Stop {nxrm}
2. Go to the location where you stored the exported databases.
3. Copy the `.bak` files you wish to restore to `$data-dir/nexus3/backup`.
4. Restart {nxrm}.

View the console logs for `database config restored`, which is logged at the `INFO` level.

NOTE: If the `Component` database is restored, the corresponding blob stores containing components must also be
restored.
