[[scripting-introduction]]
=== Introduction

Automation via scripts is a common scenario. The {nxrm} provides APIs that simplify provisioning and other tasks in
the repository manager. These APIs can be invoked from scripts that are published to the repository manager and
executed there.

=== Writing Scripts

The scripting language used on the repository manager is http://www.groovy-lang.org/[Groovy]. Any editor can be
used to author the scripts. 

The available APIs are contained in a number of JAR files. All these files, including JavaDoc and Sources
archives, are available from the http://search.maven.org[Central Repository]. They can be manually downloaded and
extracted. E.g. the different versions and the specific JAR files for `org.sonatype.nexus:nexus-core`
are available in versioned directories at `http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/sonatype/nexus/nexus-core/`.

This manual process can be simplified and improved by the usage of a Maven project declaring the relevant
components as dependencies. An example project with this setup called `nexus-script-example` and a few scripts are
available in the https://github.com/sonatype/nexus-book-examples/tree/nexus-3.0.x[documentation examples project].

Development environments such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse IDE can download the relevant JavaDoc and Sources JAR
files to ease your development. Typically you would create your scripts in `src/main/groovy` or
`src/main/scripts`.

The scripting API exposes specific tooling for IntelliJ IDEA that allows you to get access to code completion and
similar convenience features, while writing your scripts in this Maven project. Currently the API exposes four
main providers with numerous convenient methods:

* `core`
* `repository`
* `blobStore`
* `security`

The API is deliberately designed to be simple to use. It encapsulates complex configuration in single method
invocations. Many of the included methods use default values that can be omitted. For example, the method to
create a hosted repository using the Maven format in the simplest usage simply requires a name.

----
repository.createMavenHosted("private")
----

This method simply uses the default values for the rest of the parameters and is therefore equivalent to

----
repository.createMavenHosted("private", BlobStoreManager.DEFAULT_BLOBSTORE_NAME, VersionPolicy.RELEASE,
        WritePolicy.ALLOW_ONCE, LayoutPolicy.STRICT)
----

You can inspect the default values in the API documentation available by inspecting the declaration of the
specific methods in your IDE or by viewing the JavaDoc.

In terms of overall complexity of the scripts created, it is best to break large tasks up into multiple scripts
and therefore invocations.

=== Managing and Running Scripts

Once you have completed the creation of your script, you need to publish it to the repository manager for execution.
This is done by REST API invocations against the endpoint:

----
http://localhost:8081/service/siesta/rest/v1/script
----

This endpoint accepts JSON-formatted payloads with your script as the `content`.

.Example JSON formatted file `maven.json` with a simple repository creation script 
----
{
  "name": "maven",
  "type": "groovy",
  "content": "repository.createMavenHosted('private')"
}
----

The JSON file `maven.json` located in the current directory can be published to the repository manager with an
HTTP POST like

----
curl -v -X POST -u admin:admin123 --header "Content-Type: application/json" 'http://localhost:8081/service/siesta/rest/v1/script' -d @maven.json 
----

A list of scripts stored on the repository manager can be accessed with

----
curl -v -X GET -u admin:admin123 'http://localhost:8081/service/siesta/rest/v1/script'
----

The same call with a script name appended returns the actual script content.

A script can be executed by sending a POST to the `run` method of the specific script

----
curl -v -X POST -u admin:admin123 --header "Content-Type: text/plain" 'http://localhost:8081/service/siesta/rest/v1/script/maven/run'
----

A successful execution should result in a `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` result.

Scripts can be removed with a HTTP DELETE operation to the specific script:

----
curl -v -X DELETE -u admin:admin123 'http://localhost:8081/service/siesta/rest/v1/script/maven'
----

Scripts can receive run-time parameters via the REST API

----
curl -v -X POST -u admin:admin123 --header "Content-Type: text/plain" 'http://localhost:8081/service/siesta/rest/v1/script/updateAnonymousAccess/run' -d 'false'
----

and receive them as arguments that have to be parsed by the script as desired

----
security.setAnonymousAccess(Boolean.valueOf(args))
----

Interaction with the REST API for scripts can be done with any scripting language capable of HTTP calls as
mentioned above. In the following section you can find some further detailed examples.


[[scripting-examples]]
=== Examples

The API for scripts is capable of a number of different tasks. This section provides examples for script writing,
publishing and executing them.

The `simple-shell-example` project in the https://github.com/sonatype/nexus-book-examples/tree/nexus-3.0.x[scripting
section of the documentation examples project] includes a number of JSON file with simple scripts:

maven.json:: simplest script to create a hosted Maven repository
npm.json:: simple script to create a hosted and proxy repository as well as a repository group for npm usage
bower.json:: simple script to create a hosted and proxy repository as well as a repository group for bower usage
anonymous:json:: parameterized script to enable or disable anonymous access

Simple shell scripts are added to contain the curl invocations to manage scripts via the REST API:

create.sh:: Upload a specified JSON file 
delete.sh:: Delete a script specified by its name
list:sh:: List all deployed scripts
run.sh:: Run a script specified by its name
setAnonymous.sh:: Run the anonymous script on the server with the parameter `true` or `false`
update.sh:: Update an existing script by specifying the name and the JSON file to use for the update

And example sequence of creating and running a script is:

----
./create.sh maven.json
./run.sh maven
----

Subsequently you could list all scripts and delete the maven script with

----
./list.sh
./delete.sh maven
----

Since scripts are typically longer than a single line and creating them in a separate file in the IDE is
recommended, using a helper script that formats a `.groovy` file into a JSON file and submits it to the repository
manager can be a convenient approach.

The `complex-script` project in the https://github.com/sonatype/nexus-book-examples/tree/nexus-3.0.x[scripting
section of the documentation examples project] includes an example implementation using Groovy invoked from a
shell script. All scripts in this folder can be published and executed via the `provision.sh` file. This results
in the download of all required dependencies and the upload and execution of the referenced script. Alternative
you can provision the scripts individually:

----
groovy addUpdateScript.groovy -u "admin" -p "admin123" -n "raw" -f "rawRepositories.groovy" -h "http://localhost:8081"
curl -v -X POST -u admin:admin123 --header "Content-Type: text/plain" "http://localhost:8081/service/siesta/rest/v1/script/raw/run"
----

The following scripts are available:

npmAndBowerRepositories.groovy:: configures a set of proxy and hosted repositories as well as repository groups
for NPM and Bower repositories suitable for server-side and client JavaScript-based development

rawRepositories.groovy:: creates a new blob store and uses it for a hosted raw repository

security.groovy:: disables anonymous access, creates a new administrator account, creates a new role with a simple
expansion to anonymous user role and a user, creates a new role with publishing access to all repositories and a
user

core.groovy:: configures the base URL capability and a proxy server

Logging from your scripts into the repository manager logs is automatically available and performed with the usual
calls

----
log.info('User jane.doe created')
----

The result of the last script line is by default returned as a string. This can be a message as simple as 'Success!'
or more complex structured data. For instance, you can easily return JSON using built-in Groovy classes like:

----
return groovy.json.JsonOutput.toJson([result: 'Success!'])
----

which looks like

----
{
    "result": "Success!"
}
----

Passing parameters to the script can use JSON encoded arguments like

----
{
  "id": "foo",
  "name": "bar",
  "description": "baz",
  "privilegeIds": ["nx-all"],
  "roleIds": ["nx-admin"]
}
----

which in turn can be parsed using the `JsonSlurper` class in the script:

----
import groovy.json.JsonSlurper

//expects json string with appropriate content to be passed in
def role = new JsonSlurper().parseText(args)

security.addRole(role.id, role.name, role.description, role.privilegeIds, role.roleIds)
----
