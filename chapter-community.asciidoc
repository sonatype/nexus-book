== Nexus Community

=== Introduction

{base} {oss} and {base} are widely used in a large variety of organizations for
numerous different use cases.

Integrating Nexus and expanding its features is encouraged and enabled
by the availability of Nexus OSS under the Eclipse Public License,
<<confignx-sect-plugins, the REST API>> of Nexus and <<plugdev, the
support for plugins>> as part of Nexus itself, including writing your
own plugins.

A number of tools are available to facilitate the community of Nexus
users.
