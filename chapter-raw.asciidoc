[[sites-introduction]]
=== Introduction

{pro} and {oss} include support for hosting, proxying and grouping static websites - the 'raw' format. Hosted
repositories with this format can be used to store and provide a Maven-generated website. Proxy repositories can
subsequently proxy them in other servers. The 'raw' format can also be used for other resources than HTML files
exposed by straight HTTP-like browsable directory structures.

This chapter details the process of configuring raw repositories, configuring a simple Maven project to publish a
Maven-generated project site and other use cases for raw repositories.

[[raw-hosted]]
=== Creating a Hosted Raw Repository

To create a raw repository for hosting a static website, you simply create a new repository using the 'raw
(hosted)' recipe as documented in <<admin-repositories>>.

For the Maven site example in <<maven-site>>, set the 'Name' to `site` and change the 'Deployment policy' to
'Allow redeploy'.

After creating the new raw repository, it appears in the list of repositories with the name 'site' provided
earlier. The 'URL' in the list can be used for deployment and access usage.

[[maven-site]]
=== Creating and Deploying a Maven Site

==== Creating a New Maven Project

In this section, you are be creating a minimal Maven project with a simple website that can be published to the
hosted raw repository created in <<raw-hosted>>.

The following steps can be used to create a new Maven project:

* Run the command +mvn archetype:generate+ in a command line interface
* Confirm the first prompt using the default selection (number will vary)
* Confirm the default selection for the archetype version
* Set the groupId to `org.sonatype.books.nexus`
* Set the artifactId to `sample-site`
* Confirm the default version of `1.0-SNAPSHOT`
* Confirm the preset package of `org.sonatype.books.nexus`
* Confirm the properties configuration

After running the +archetype:generate+ command, you will have a new project in a `sample-site` directory.

==== Configuring Maven for Site Deployment

To deploy a site to a raw repository in the repository manager, you need to configure the project's
`distributionManagement`, add site deployment information, and then update your Maven settings to include the
appropriate credentials.

Add the following section to `sample-site/pom.xml` before the dependencies element.  This section tells Maven
where to publish the Maven-generated project website:

[[ex-sites-dist-man]]
.Distribution Management for Site Deployment
----
<distributionManagement>
  <site>
    <id>nexus</id>
    <url>dav:http://localhost:8081/repository/site/</url>
  </site>
</distributionManagement>
----

The URL in the distribution management is not parameterized, which means that any redeployment overwrites old
content and potentially leaves old stale files behind. To have a new deployment directory for each version, change
the URL to a parameterized setup or change the whole URL between deployments.

If you combine this approach with a redirector or a static page that links to the different copies of your site,
you can e.g., maintain separate sites hosting your javadoc and other documentation for different releases of your
software.

The dav protocol used by for deployment to the repository manager requires that you add the implementing library
as a dependency of the Maven site plugin in your Maven project:

[[ex-sites-dav]]
.Dependency for the Maven Site Plugin for DAV Support
----

<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <artifactId>maven-site-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>3.4</version>
      <dependencies>
        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.apache.maven.wagon</groupId>
          <artifactId>wagon-webdav-jackrabbit</artifactId>
          <version>2.8</version>
        </dependency>
      </dependencies>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
----

==== Adding Credentials to Your Maven Settings

When the Maven site plugin deploys a site, it needs to supply the appropriate deployment credentials to the
repository manager. To configure this, you need to add credentials to your Maven settings.  Edit your
`~/.m2/settings.xml` file and add the following server configuration to the servers element.

[[ex-sites-deploy-credentials]]
.Configuring Deployment Credentials for Site Deployment
----
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>nexus</id>
      <username>admin</username>
      <password>admin123</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
----

NOTE: <<ex-sites-deploy-credentials>> uses the default `admin` username and password. For real world usage you
would use the username and password of a user with the privilege to write to the target repository.

==== Publishing a Maven Site

To publish the site to the hosted raw repository in the repository manager, run `mvn site-deploy` from the
`sample-site` directory.  The Maven site plugin will deploy this site to the repository using the credentials
stored in your Maven settings:

Once the site has been published, you can load the site in a browser by going to

=== Proxying and Grouping Raw Repositories

Beside the common use case using hosted raw repositories for site deployments, the repository manager supports
proxying as well as grouping of raw repositories.

The creation follows the same process as documented in <<admin-repositories>> using the 'raw (proxy)' and the 'raw
(group)' recipes.

A raw proxy repository can be used to proxy any static website. This includes a Maven site hosted in a raw
repository in another {nxrm} server or a plain static website hosted on another web server like Apache httpd. It
can also be used to proxy directory structures exposed via a web server to distribute archives such as
`https://nodejs.org/dist/`.

NOTE: No content is modified when proxied. This means that e.g., any absolute URL used with HTML document remain
absolute and therefore bypass the proxying mechanism.

Grouping raw repositories is possible and can e.g., be used to aggregate multiple site repositories. However keep
in mind that the raw format does not contain any logic to resolve conflicts between the different repositories in
the group. Any request to the group causes the repository manager to check the member repositories in order and
return the first matching content.

=== Uploading Files to Hosted Raw Repositories

Many other tools, besides using Maven, can be used to upload files to a hosted raw repository. A simple HTTP PUT
can upload files. The following example uses the `curl` command and the default credentials of the `admin` user to
upload a `test.png` file to a hosted raw repository with the name `documentation`.

.An Example Upload Command Using `curl`: 
----
curl -v --user 'admin:admin123' --upload-file ./test.png http://localhost:8081/repository/documentation/test.png 
----

After a completed upload the repository manager provides the file at the URL
`http://localhost:8081/repository/documentation/test.png`. Using this approach in a script entire static websites
or any other binary resources can be uploaded.
