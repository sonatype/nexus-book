[[nuget]]
== .NET Package Repositories with NuGet

{inall}

=== Introduction

With the creation of the http://nuget.org/[NuGet] project, a
package management solution for .NET developers has become
available. Similar to Apache Maven dependency management for Java developers,
NuGet makes it easy to add, remove, and update libraries and tools in
Visual Studio projects that use the .NET Framework. 

The project websites at http://www.nuget.org[www.nuget.org] and
https://github.com/NuGet/Home[https://github.com/NuGet/Home] host tool
downloads and detailed documentation as well as links to further
resources and provide a repository and features to upload your open
source NuGet packages. With the NuGet Gallery a repository of open
source libraries and tools is available and the need for repository
management arises.

IMPORTANT: With the release of version 2.9, NuGet support is available in {pro} and {oss}.

{pro} and {oss} support the NuGet repository format for hosted and proxy repositories. They also supports
aggregation of NuGet repositories and conversion of other repositories containing +.nupkg+ components to the NuGet
format. This allows you to improve collaboration and control, while speeding up .NET development, facilitating
open source libraries and sharing of internal component across teams. When you standardize on a single repository
for all your development and use it for internal components as well, you will get all the benefits of using a
repository manager when working in the .NET architecture.

To share a library or tool with NuGet, you create a NuGet package and store it in the repository manager-based
NuGet repository. Similarly, you can use packages others have created and made available in their NuGet
repositories by proxying them or downloading the packages and installing them in your own hosted repository for
third party packages.

NOTE: Users can enable Repository Health Check on a repository using the NuGet format to retrieve all metadata 
from components in the repository, such as security and license. See <<rhc>> for details.

The NuGet Visual Studio extension allows you to download the package from the repository and install it in your
Visual Studio project or solution. NuGet copies everything and makes any required changes to your project setup
and configuration files. Removing a package will clean up any changes as required.

TIP: Using NuGet repositories benefits from a larger memory size available to the repository manager. This memory
allocation can be configured in +wrapper.conf+ as documented in <<running>>.


[[nuget-nuget_proxy_repositories]]
=== NuGet Proxy Repositories

The NuGet Gallery is the central repository used by all package authors and consumers. To reduce duplicate
downloads and improve download speeds for your developers and CI servers, you should proxy the NuGet Gallery with
the repository manager. If you use other external repositories, you should also proxy these.

To proxy an external NuGet repository, you simply create a new 'Proxy
Repository' as documented in <<confignx-sect-manage-repo>>. The
'Provider' has to be set to +NuGet+. The 'Remote Storage Location' has
to be set to the URL of the remote repository you want to proxy. The
URL for the main NuGet Gallery repository is 

----
https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/
----

A complete configuration for proxying the NuGet Gallery is visible in
<<fig-nuget-proxy-org>>.

[[fig-nuget-proxy-org]]

The repository configuration for a NuGet proxy repository has an
additional tab titled 'NuGet' as visible in
<<fig-nuget-gallery-package-source>>. It displays the 'Package Source'
URL that is URL where the repository is available as a NuGet repository.

By default, searches in NuGet repositories in the repository manager are passed through to the remote
repositories, and the search results are merged with internal search results and included in an internally managed
index. This merging has to make some assumptions to generate component counts.

[[nuget-nuget_hosted_repositories]]
=== NuGet Hosted Repositories

A hosted repository for NuGet can be used to upload your own
packages as well as third-party packages. It is good practice to
create two separate hosted repositories for these purposes.

To create a NuGet hosted repository, simply create a new 'Hosted
Repository' and set the 'Provider' to +NuGet+. A sample configuration for an
internal releases NuGet hosted repository is displayed in
<<fig-nuget-hosted-releases-configuration>>.

[[fig-nuget-hosted-releases-configuration]]
.Example Configuration for a NuGet Hosted Repository for Release Packages
image::figs/web/nuget-hosted-releases-configuration.png[scale=50]

Besides the 'NuGet' tab, the configuration for the repository has
a 'NuPkg Upload' tab as displayed in <<fig-nuget-hosted-nupkg-upload>>
that allows you to manually upload one or multiple packages.

[[fig-nuget-hosted-nupkg-upload]]
.The NuPkg Upload Panel for a Hosted NuGet Repository
image::figs/web/nuget-hosted-nupkg-upload.png[scale=40]

The NuGet feed is immediately updated as packages are deployed or
deleted from the host repository. To rebuild the feed for a hosted 
NuGet repository you can manually schedule a 'Rebuild NuGet Feed'
task.

=== NuGet Virtual Repositories

If you have deployed NuGet packages to a Maven repository in the past,
you can expose them to Visual Studio by creating a virtual repository
as documented in <<confignx-sect-manage-repo>> and setting the
'Provider' to +NuGet+. The setup displayed in
<<fig-nuget-virtual-releases>> shows a virtual repository configured
to expose the content of the regular Maven 'Releases' repository as a
NuGet repository, so that NuGet can access any NuGet packages
deployed to the releases repository.

[[fig-nuget-virtual-releases]]

The NuGet feed is immediately updated as packages are deployed or
deleted from the shadowed repository. To rebuild the feed for a 
virtual NuGet repository, you can manually schedule a 
'Synchronize Shadow Repository' task.

[[nuget-nuget_group_repositories]]
=== NuGet Group Repositories

A repository group is the recommended way to expose all your NuGet repositories to your users, without needing any
further client side configuration. A repository group allows you to expose the aggregated content of multiple
proxy and hosted repositories with one URL to your tools. This is possible for NuGet repositories by creating a
new 'Repository Group' with the 'Provider' set to +NuGet+ as documented in <<repository-groups>>.

A typical, useful example would be to group the proxy repository that
proxies the NuGet Gallery, a NuGet, hosted repository with internal
software packages and another NuGet, hosted repository with third-party
packages. The configuration for such a setup is displayed in
<<fig-nuget-group>>.

[[fig-nuget-group]]
.A Public NuGet Group Combining a Proxy and Two Hosted Repositories
image::figs/web/nuget-group.png[scale=50]

Using the 'Repository Path' of the repository group as your NuGet
repository URL in your client tool will give you access to the
packages in all three repositories with one URL. Any new packages
added as well as any new repositories added to the group will
automatically be available.

[[nuget-configuring]]
=== Accessing Packages in Repositories and Groups

Once you have set up your hosted and proxy repositories for NuGet
packages, and potentially created a repository group, you can access
them with the +nuget+ tool on the command line. Copy the 'Package Source'
URL from the 'NuGet' tab of the repository/group configuration you want
to access and add it to +nuget+ on the command line with e.g.:

----
nuget sources add -name NuGetNexus -source http://localhost:8081/nexus/service/local/nuget/nuget-public
----

Replace +localhost+ with the public hostname or URL of your repository manager and +nuget-public+ with the name of
the repository you want to proxy. Ideally, this will be your NuGet group.

After this source was added, you can list the available packages with 
the command +nuget list+.

Access to the packages is not restricted by default. If access restrictions are desired, you can
<<security,configure security>> directly or via <<ldap,LDAP/Active Directory external role mappings>> combined
with <<repository-targets,repository targets>> for fine grained control. Authentication from NuGet is then handled
via NuGet API keys as documented in <<nuget-deploying_packages_to_nuget_hosted_repositories>>.


[[nuget-deploying_packages_to_nuget_hosted_repositories]]
=== Deploying Packages to NuGet Hosted Repositories

In order to authenticate a client against a NuGet repository, NuGet uses
an API key for deployment requests. These keys are generated separately
on request from a user account on the NuGet gallery and can be
regenerated at any time. At regeneration, all previous keys generated
for that user are invalid.

==== Creating a NuGet API-Key

For usage with the repository manager, NuGet API keys are only needed when packages are going to be deployed;
therefore, API key generation is by default not exposed in the user interface to normal users. Only users with at
least the 'Deployment' role have access to the API keys.

Other users that should be able to access and create an API key have
to be given the 'Nexus API-Key Access' role in the 'Users' security
administration.

In addition, the 'NuGet API-Key Realm' has to be activated. To do this, simply add the realm to the selected
realms in the 'Security Settings' section of the 'Server' configuration available in the 'Administration' submenu
of the left-hand navigation panel.

Once this is set up, you can view as well as reset the current
'Personal API Key' in the 'NuGet' tab of any NuGet proxy or hosted
repository as visible in <<fig-nuget-api-key>>

==== Creating a Package for Deployment

Creating a package for deployment can be done with the +pack+ command of
the +nuget+ command line tool or within Visual Studio. Detailed
documentation can be found on the http://docs.nuget.org/[NuGet
website].

==== Deployment with the NuPkg Upload User Interface

Manual upload of one or multiple packages is done on the 'NuPkg Upload'
tab of the repository displayed in
<<fig-nuget-hosted-nupkg-upload>>. Press the 'Browse' button to access
the package you want to upload on the file system and press 'Add
Package'. Repeat this process for all  packages you want upload, and
press 'Upload Package(s)' to complete the upload.

==== Command line based Deployment to a Nexus NuGet Hosted Repository

Alternatively to manual uploads, the +nuget+ command line tool allows
you to deploy packages to a repository with the +push+ command. The
command requires you to use the 'API Key' and the 'Package Source'
path. Both of them are available in the NuGet tab of the hosted NuGet
repository to where you want to deploy. Using the +delete+ command 
of +nuget+ allows you to remove packages in a similar fashion.


Further information about the command line tool is available in the
http://docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/command-line-reference[on-line
help].

[[nuget-integration_of_nexus_nuget_repositories_in_visual_studio]]
=== Integration of NuGet Repositories in Visual Studio

In order to access a NuGet repository or preferably all NuGet repositories exposed in a group from the repository
manager, you provide the 'Name' and 'Source' to the Visual Studio configuration for the 'Package Sources' of the
'NuGet Package Manager' as displayed in <<fig-nuget-visualstudio-packageoptions>>.

[[fig-nuget-visualstudio-packageoptions]]
.Package Source Configuration for the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio
image::figs/web/nuget-visualstudio-packageoptions.png[scale=60]

With this configuration in place, all packages available in your NuGet repository will be available in the 'NuGet
Package Manager' in Visual Studio.
