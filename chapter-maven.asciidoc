== Configuring Maven and Other Build Tools

{inall}

[[config-sect-intro]]
=== Introduction

Historically {pro} and {oss} started as a repository manager supporting the Maven repository format. While it
supports many other repository formats now, the Maven repository format is still the most common and well
supported format for build and provisioning tools running on the JVM and beyond.

This chapter shows example configurations for using the repository manager with Apache Maven and a number of other
tools. The setups take advantage of merging many repositories and exposing them via a repository group. Setting
this up is documented in the chapter in addition to the configuration used by specific tools.


[[config-maven]]
=== Apache Maven

To use {pro} and {oss} with http://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven], we configure Maven to check the repository
manager instead of the default, built-in connection to the Central Repository.

To do this, you add a +mirror+ configuration and override the default
configuration for the +central+ repository in your +~/.m2/settings.xml+
as shown in <<ex-maven-nexus-simple>>.

[[ex-maven-nexus-simple]]

----
<settings>
  <mirrors>
    <mirror>
      <!--This sends everything else to /public -->
      <id>nexus</id>
      <mirrorOf>*</mirrorOf>
      <url>http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/groups/public</url>
    </mirror>
  </mirrors>
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>nexus</id>
      <!--Enable snapshots for the built in central repo to direct -->
      <!--all requests to nexus via the mirror -->
      <repositories>
        <repository>
          <id>central</id>
          <url>http://central</url>
          <releases><enabled>true</enabled></releases>
          <snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
        </repository>
      </repositories>
     <pluginRepositories>
        <pluginRepository>
          <id>central</id>
          <url>http://central</url>
          <releases><enabled>true</enabled></releases>
          <snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
        </pluginRepository>
      </pluginRepositories>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
  <activeProfiles>
    <!--make the profile active all the time -->
    <activeProfile>nexus</activeProfile>
  </activeProfiles>
</settings>
----

In <<ex-maven-nexus-simple>>, we have defined a single profile called +nexus+. It configures a +repository+ and a
+pluginRepository+ with the id +central+ that overrides the same repositories in the super pom. The super pom is
internal to every Apache Maven install and establishes default values. These overrides are important since they
change the repositories by enabling snapshots and replacing the URL with a bogus URL. This URL is overridden by
the +mirror+ setting in the same settings.xml file to point to the URL of your single repository group. This group
can, therefore, contain release as well as snapshot components and Maven will pick them up.

The +mirrorOf+ pattern of +*+ causes any repository request to be
redirected to this mirror and to your single repository group, which
in the example is the +public+ group.

It is possible to use other patterns in the mirrorOf field. A possible
valuable setting is to use +external:*+. This matches all repositories
except those using +localhost+ or file based repositories. This is
used in conjunction with a repository manager when you want to exclude
redirecting repositories that are defined for integration testing. The
integration test runs for Apache Maven itself require this setting.

More documentation about mirror settings can be found in the
http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-mirror-settings.html[mini
guide on the Maven web site].

As a last configuration the +nexus+ profile is listed as an active
profile in the +activeProfiles+ element.

[[config-sect-custom]]  
=== Adding Repositories for Missing Dependencies

If you've configured your Maven +settings.xml+ or other build tool configuration to use the +public+ repository
group as a mirror for all repositories, you might encounter projects that are unable to retrieve components from
your local repository manager installation.

This usually happens because you are trying to build a project that
has defined a custom set of repositories and snapshot repositories or
relies on the content of other publically available repositories in
its configuration. When you encounter such a project all you have to
do is 

* add this repository to your repository manager as a new proxy repository 
* and then add the new proxy repository to the public group.

The advantage of this approach is that no configuration change on the
build tool side is necessary at all.

[[config-sect-new-repo]]
=== Adding a New Repository

To add a repository, log in as an administrator, and click on the 'Repositories' link in the left-hand navigation
menu in the 'Views/Repositories' section as displayed in <<fig-repository-manager-add-repository-dropdown>>.

Clicking on this link should bring up a window that lists all the configured repositories. You'll then want to
create a new proxy repository. To do this, click on the 'Add' link that is directly above the list of
repositories. When you click the 'Add' button, click the down arrow directly to the right of the word 'Add', this
will show a drop-down which has the options: 'Hosted Repository', 'Proxy Repository', 'Virtual Repository', and
'Repository Group'. Since you are creating a proxy repository, click on 'Proxy Repository'.

[[fig-repository-manager-add-repository-dropdown]]
.Creating a New Proxy Repository
image::figs/web/repository-manager_add-repository-dropdown.png[scale=50]

Once you do this, you will see a screen resembling
<<fig-add-repo>>. Populate the required fields 'Repository ID' and the
'Repository Name'. The 'Repository ID' will be part of the URL used to
access the repository, so it is recommended to avoid characters that
could cause problems there or on the filesystem storage. It is best to
stick with lowercase alphanumerics. Set the 'Repository Policy' to
'Release', and the 'Remote Storage Location' to the public URL of the
repository you want to proxy.


[[fig-add-repo]]
.Configuring a Proxy Repository
image::figs/web/repository-manager_add-repository.png[scale=50]

Once you've filled out this screen, click on the 'Save' button. The repository manager is now configured to proxy
the repository. If the remote repository contains snapshots as well as release components, you will need to repeat
the process creating a second proxy repository and setting the policy to 'Snapshots'.

++++
endif::[]

[[config-sect-repo-group]]  
=== Adding a Repository to a Group

Next you will need to add the new repositories to the 'Public Repositories' repository group. To do this, click on
the 'Repositories' link in the left-hand main menu in the 'Views/Repositories' section. The repository manager
lists Groups and Repositories in the same list so click on the public group.  After clicking on the 'Public
Repositories' group, you should see the 'Browse' and 'Configuration' tabs in the lower half of the user interface.

NOTE: If you click on a repository or a group in the 'Repositories' list
and you do not see the 'Configuration' tab, this is because your 
user account does not have administrative privileges. To perform the
configuration tasks outlined in this chapter, you will need to be
logged in as a user with administrative privileges.

Clicking on the 'Configuration' tab will bring up a screen which looks
like <<fig-add-to-group>>.

[[fig-add-to-group]]
.Adding New Repositories to a Repository Group
image::figs/web/repository-manager_add-to-group.png[scale=50]

To add the new repository to the public group, find the repository in
the  'Available Repositories' list on the right, click on the
repository you want to add and drag it to the left to the 'Ordered
Group Repositories' list. Once the repository is in the 'Ordered Group
Repositories' list you can click and drag the repository within that
list to alter the order in which a repository will be searched for a
matching component.

NOTE: The repository manager user interface makes use of the Javascript widget library
 http://extjs.com/[ExtJS]. ExtJS provides for a number of UI widgets that allow for rich interaction like the
 drag-drop UI for adding repositories to a group and reordering the contents of a group.

In the last few sections, you learned how to add a new custom
repositories to a build in order to download components that are not
available in the Central Repository.

If you were not using a repository manager, you would have added these repositories to the repository element of
your project's POM, or you would have asked all of your developers to modify +~/.m2/settings.xml+ to reference two
new repositories. Instead, you used the repository manager to add the two repositories to the public group. If all
of the developers are configured to point to the public repository group, you can freely swap in new repositories
without asking your developers to change local configuration, and you've gained a certain amount of control over
which repositories are made available to your development team. In addition the performance of the component
resolving across multiple repositories will be handled by repository manager and therefore be much faster than
client side resolution done by Maven each time.


[[ant-ivy]]
=== Apache Ant and Apache Ivy

http://ant.apache.org/ivy/[Apache Ivy] is a dependency manager often used in Apache Ant builds. It supports the
Maven repository format and can be configured to download dependencies that can be declared in the +ivy.xml+
file. This configuration can be contained in the +ivysettings.xml+. A minimal example for resolving dependencies
from a repository manager running on +localhost+ is shown in <<ivysettings-minimal>>.

[[ivysettings-minimal]]
.Minimal Apache Ivy Settings
----
<ivysettings>
  <settings defaultResolver="nexus"/>
  <property name="nexus-public"
                   value="http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/groups/public"/>
  <resolvers>
      <ibiblio name="nexus" m2compatible="true" root="${nexus-public}"/>
    </resolvers>
</ivysettings>
----

These minimal settings allow the +ivy:retrieve+ task to download the declared
dependencies.

To deploy build outputs to a repository with the +ivy:publish+ task, user credentials and the URL of the target
repository have to be added to +ivysettings.xml+ and the makepom and publish tasks have to be configured and
invoked.

Full example projects can be found in the +ant-ivy+ folder of the
https://github.com/sonatype/nexus-book-examples[documentation examples project]. A full build of the
+simple-project+, including downloading the declared dependencies and uploading the build output to the repository
manager can be invoked with

----
cd ant-ivy/simple-project
ant deploy
----

Further details about using these example projects can be found in <<eval>>.


[[ant-aether]]
=== Apache Ant and Eclipse Aether

http://www.eclipse.org/aether/[Eclipse Aether] is the dependency
management component used in Apache Maven 3+. The project provides Ant
tasks that can be configured to download dependencies that can be
declared in +pom.xml+ file or in the Ant build file directly.

This configuration can be contained in your Ant +build.xml+ or a separate file that is imported. A minimal example
for resolving dependencies from a repository manager running on +localhost+ is shown in <<aether-minimal>>.

[[aether-minimal]]
.Minimal Setup for Aether Ant Tasks
----
<project xmlns:aether="antlib:org.eclipse.aether.ant" ....>
  <taskdef uri="antlib:org.eclipse.aether.ant" 
      resource="org/eclipse/aether/ant/antlib.xml">
    <classpath>
      <fileset dir="${aether.basedir}" 
                   includes="aether-ant-tasks-*.jar" />
    </classpath>
  </taskdef>
  <aether:mirror id="mirror" 
     url="http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/groups/public/" 
     mirrorOf="*"/>
...
</project>
----


These minimal settings allow the +aether:resolve+ task to download the declared dependencies.

To deploy build outputs to a repository with the +aether:deploy+ task, user authentication and details about the
target repositories have to be added .

Full example projects can be found in the +ant-aether+ folder of the
https://github.com/sonatype/nexus-book-examples[documentation examples project]. A full build of the
+simple-project+, including downloading the declared dependencies and uploading the build output to Nexus can be
invoked with

----
cd ant-aether/simple-project
ant deploy
----

Further details about using these example projects can be found in <<eval>>.


[[gradle]]
=== Gradle

http://www.gradle.org/[Gradle] has a built in dependency management component that supports
the Maven repository format. In order to configure a Gradle project to
resolve +dependencies+ declared in +build.gradle+ file, a +maven+
repository as shown in <<gradle-minimal>> has to be declared


[[gradle-minimal]]
.Minimal Gradle Setup
----
repositories {
    maven {
        url "http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/groups/public"
    }
}
----

These minimal settings allow Gradle to download the declared
dependencies.

The above setup is specific to each project. Alternatively an +init.gradle+ file placed e.g., in +~/.gradle+ can
establish the repository as the source for dependencies in all projects. A simple implementation could look
like

----
allprojects {
  ext.RepoConfigurator = {
    maven { 
      url = uri('http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/groups/public') }
  }
  buildscript.repositories RepoConfigurator
  repositories RepoConfigurator
----

Other setup could be an expansion of the following example allowing file system based repostories:

----
/**
 * init.gradle file for development using the Nexus Repository Manager as proxy repository
 * 
 * @author Manfred Moser <manfred@simpligility.com
 */

apply plugin:NexusRepositoryPlugin

class NexusRepositoryPlugin implements Plugin<Gradle> {

  final static String LOG_PREFIX = "init.gradle/NexusRepositoryPlugin:"

  final Closure NexusConfig = {
    maven {
      name = 'standard-nexus'
      url = 'http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/groups/public'
    }
    // if required you can add further repositories or groups here 
    // and they will be left intact if the name starts with standard-
    // although it is better to just add those repositories in Nexus 
    // and expose them via the public group
  }

  final Closure RepoHandler = {
    all { ArtifactRepository repo ->
      if (repo.name.toString().startsWith("standard-") ) {
         println "$LOG_PREFIX $repo.name at $repo.url activated as repository."
      } else {
        if (repo instanceof MavenArtifactRepository) {
          remove repo
          println "$LOG_PREFIX $repo.name at $repo.url removed."
        } else {
          println "$LOG_PREFIX $repo.name kept (not a Maven repository)."
        }
      }
    }
  }

          
  void apply(Gradle gradle) {
    // Override all project specified Maven repos with standard 
    // defined in here
    gradle.allprojects{ project ->
      println "$LOG_PREFIX  Reconfiguring repositories."
      project.repositories RepoHandler
      project.buildscript.repositories RepoHandler

      project.repositories NexusConfig
      project.buildscript.repositories NexusConfig
    }
  }
}
----

Gradle init scripts can be much more powerful and customized and are
explained with more examples in the
http://gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/init_scripts.html[official
Gradle documentation].

To deploy build outputs to a repository with the +uploadArchives+
task, user authentication can be declared in e.g.,
+gradle.properties+:

----
nexusUrl=http://localhost:8081/nexus
nexusUsername=admin
nexusPassword=admin123
----

and then used in the `uploadArchives` task with a `mavenDeployer`
configuration from the Maven plugin:

----
uploadArchives {
  repositories {
    mavenDeployer {
      repository(
        url: "${nexusUrl}/content/repositories/releases") {
          authentication(userName: nexusUsername, password: nexusPassword)
      }
      snapshotRepository(
        url: "${nexusUrl}/content/repositories/snapshots") {
          authentication(userName: nexusUsername, password: nexusPassword)
      }
    }
  }
}
----


Full example projects can be found in the +gradle+ folder of the
https://github.com/sonatype/nexus-book-examples[documentation examples project]. A full build of the
+simple-project+, including downloading the declared dependencies and uploading the build output to repository
manager can be invoked with

----
cd gradle/simple-project
gradle upload
----

Further details about using these example projects can be found in <<eval>>.

[[sbt]]
=== SBT

http://www.scala-sbt.org/[sbt] has a built in dependency management
component and defaults to the Maven repository format. In order to
configure a sbt project to resolve dependencies declared in
+build.sbt+ file, a +resolver+  as shown in
<<sbt-minimal>> has to be declared


[[sbt-minimal]]
.Minimal SBT Configuration
----
resolvers += "Nexus" at "http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/groups/public"
----

These minimal settings allow sbt to download the declared dependencies.

To deploy build outputs to a Nexus repository with the +publish+
task, user credentials can be declared in the +build.sbt+ file:

[subs="attributes"]
----
credentials += Credentials("Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager",
"nexus.scala-tools.org", "admin", "admin123")
----

TIP: The credentials string should never change, as third-party clients depend on it

And then used in the +publishTo+ configuration:

----
publishTo <<= version { v: String =>
  val nexus = "http://localhost:8081/nexus/" 
  if (v.trim.endsWith("SNAPSHOT"))
    Some("snapshots" at nexus + "content/repositories/snapshots")
  else
    Some("releases" at nexus + "content/repositories/releases")
----

Further documentation can be found in the
http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Publishing.html[sbt
documentation on publishing].


[[leiningen]]
=== Leiningen

http://leiningen.org/[Leiningen] has a built in dependency management
component and defaults to the Maven repository format. As a build tool
it is mostly used for projects using the http://clojure.org/[Clojure]
language. Many libraries useful for these projects are published to
the Clojars repository.

If you want use Nexus with Leiningen, first create *two* new Maven 2 proxy
repositories in Nexus with the remote URL +http://clojars.org/repo/+. 
One of these should have the +Repository Policy+ set to +Release+ and the
other should have policy +Snapshot+. Then add both to your Maven 2 public group.

In order to configure a Leinigen project to resolve dependencies declared in
the +project.clj+ file, a +mirrors+ section overriding the built in +central+
and +clojars+ repositories as shown in <<leiningen-minimal>> has to be declared.


[[leiningen-minimal]]
.Minimal Leiningen Configuration
----
:mirrors {
  "central" {
    :name "Nexus"
    :url "http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/groups/public"
    :repo-manager true
  }
  #"clojars" {
    :name "Nexus"
    :url "http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/groups/public"
    :repo-manager true}
  }
----

These minimal settings allow Leiningen to download the declared
dependencies.

To deploy build outputs to a Nexus repository with the +deploy+
command, the target repositories have to be add to +project.clj+ as
+deploy-repositories+. This avoids Leiningen checking for dependencies
in these repositories, which is not necessary, since they are already
part of the Nexus +public+ repository group used in +mirrors+.

----
  :deploy-repositories [
    ["snapshots" 
      "http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots"]
    ["releases" 
      "http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/releases"]
  ]
----

User credentials can be declared in +~/.lein/credentials.clj.gpg+ or
will be prompted for.

Further documentation can be found on the http://leiningen.org/[Leiningen website].
