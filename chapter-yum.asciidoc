[[yum]]
== RPM Packages and YUM Repositories

[[yum-introduction]]
=== Introduction

http://www.rpm.org/[RPM] packages and the RPM package manager solution
http://yum.baseurl.org/[yum] are used as the default application
package manager on Linux based operating systems such as
http://www.redhat.com/[Red Hat], http://www.centos.org/[CentOS],
https://getfedora.org/[Fedora],
http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/linux/overview/index.html[Oracle
Linux], https://www.suse.com/[SUSE],
http://www.opensuse.org/[openSUSE],
https://www.scientificlinux.org/[Scientific Linux] and others.

The yum repository support of Nexus allows you to expose RPM packages
hosted in a Maven repository in the yum repository format. It
generates the yum metadata, so that systems with yum support can use
Nexus as a software package repository.

This enables a build and deployment pipeline for Java or other
JVM-based applications via Maven repositories to Linux
computers. E.g., a Java Enterprise Archive (EAR) or Web Archive (WAR)
or some other application is deployed to a Maven repository. The
deployment is performed by a CI server build using Maven or other build
systems or as a manually run deployment. Once Nexus hosts the
application RPM package, it can be retrieved via yum for installation and
updates on testing and production systems. The metadata of the RPM
package can additionally trigger installation of other required packages
including e.g. a Java runtime or an application server.

[[yum-installation]]
=== Installation and Requirements

Yum support is bundled with all Nexus editions and no further
installation steps are required. It relies on the commands
+createrepo+ and +mergerepo+ to be installed on the operating system
running the Nexus server and to be available on the path. Documentation
about these commands can be found on the
http://createrepo.baseurl.org/[createrepo website]. Typically
+createrepo+ is installed on RPM-based Linux distributions and as such
they are suitable to run Nexus with yum support. If desired the path
to the commands can be configured in the Nexus user interface.

If your RPM-based system does not have this command you can install it
by running 
----
yum install createrepo
----
with a sufficiently privileged user.

[[yum-configuration]]
=== Configuration

Yum related configuration is done with the 'Capabilites' management of
Nexus as documented in <<capabilities>>. 

The capability 'Yum: Configuration' allows you to enable or disable
yum support. It can only be enabled successfully, if the 'createrepo'
and the 'mergerepo' commands can be found by Nexus. By default Nexus
will look for them on the path. The configuration settings
'Path of "createrepo"' and 'Path of "mergerepo"' allow you to
alternatively configure a specific absolute path.

The parameter 'Max number of parallel threads' defaults to ten and
defines how many threads can be used to manage the yum repositories
with the 'createrepo' and the 'mergerepo' commands.

You need to ensure that this capability is enabled, before proceeding
with your repository specific configuration. The 'Status' tab of the
capability displays the detected versions for +createrepo+ and
+mergerepo+ and details any problems as applicable. 

==== Configure Hosted Yum Repositories

To expose a Maven repository like 'Releases' via yum, press the 'New'
button in the capabilities configuration tab and select 'Yum: Generate
Metadata' from the 'Type' drop down in the dialog displayed in
<<fig-yum-hosted>>.

[[fig-yum-hosted]]

The 'Repository' drop down allows you to select the hosted Maven
repository. Release as well as snapshot policy repositories can be
configured. Once configured, any RPM package added to the hosted Maven
repository is available via yum. The same URL of the repository
used for Maven based access e.g.,
+http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/releases+ and
displayed in the repository administration area list, can be used as
the URL for a yum repository in the yum configuration.

The Nexus yum integration supports versioned views on a
repository. The URL
+http://localhost:8081/nexus/service/local/yum/repos/releases/1.2.3/+
exposes a yum repository with all packages with version +1.2.3+ in the
+releases+ repository. A custom repodata folder is available at the
context.

The 'Aliases' field can be used to define alternative access paths to
specific versions. For example, you can configure alias values of

----
production=1.2,testing=2.0
----

These values would in turn expose the version +1.2+ under a URL like
+http://localhost:8081/nexus/service/local/yum/repos/releases/production/+
and the version `2.0` at
+http://localhost:8081/nexus/service/local/yum/repos/releases/testing/+. Using
these URLs in the yum configuration on the target servers as a static
URL enables upgrades to new versions by simply changing the alias
e.g. to `production=1.3` and running a yum update command on the target server.

Besides maintaining the aliases in the capability administration, it is
possible to create or update an alias in the command line:

----
curl -d "1.0" --header "Content-Type: text/plain" http://localhost:8081/nexus/service/local/yum/alias/releases/development/
----

Usage of the alias-based URL is done via the normal yum configuration
e.g. with a file +/etc/yum.repos.d/nexus-production.repo+ and the following content:

----
[nexus-production]
name=Nexus Production Repository
baseurl=http://localhost:8081/nexus/service/local/yum/repos/releases/production/
enabled=1
protect=0
gpgcheck=0
metadata_expire=30s
autorefresh=1
type=rpm-md
Promote RPM through Stages
----
By deploying new versions and switching alias associations to the
versions, a controlled roll out of new versions of RPM archives to
target servers can be achieved.

The configuration options 'Process deletes' and 'Delete process delay'
can be used to enable updates to the yum metadata, following delete
operations of rpm packages in the Maven repository.

The 'Yum groups definition file' configuration allows you to configure
a path to a package groups configuration file. This file is typically
named comps.xml and can be used to define a group of RPM packages. The
groups can then be managed with commands such as +yum grouplist+, +yum
groupinstall+ and +yum groupremove+.

Once the capability is saved, the 'Status' tab displays an example yum
configuration for accessing the repository. Each RPM deployed to the
repository causes Nexus to update the yum metadata immediately.

The metadata used by yum is available in the +repodata+ context e.g., at
+.../nexus/content/repositories/releases/repodata+, in the following
files. Apart from the +repomd.xml+ file, the files are prepended with
a unique hash value as part of the name to avoid caching issues:

+repomd.xml+:: This XML file contains information about the other
metadata files.
+hash-primary.xml.gz+:: This zipped XML file describes the primary
metadata of each RPM archive in the repository.
+hash-filelists.xml.gz+:: This zipped XML file describes all the files
contained within each RPM archive.
+hash-other.xml.gz+:: This zipped XML file contains further,
miscellaneous information regarding each RPM archive.


==== Proxying Repositories

The Nexus yum integration is able to proxy yum-enabled Maven
repositories from remote Nexus servers. The metadata in these
repositories contains absolute URLs, which will cause yum to use
these URLs. The capability 'Yum: Proxy Metadata' can be configured on
such a proxy repository. It will cause the URLs in the metadata to be
rewritten and corrected for the current Nexus server. 

This allows the proxy repositories to be part of a repository group
and expose the correct yum metadata via the merged metadata creation
on the group. 

==== Configure Repository Group for yum

To expose a Maven repository group to yum, simply add a new capability
with the type 'Yum: Merge Metadata' and select the repository group in
the 'Group' drop down. <<fig-yum-group>> shows the 'Settings' tab for
the 'Public Repositories' configured for yum.

[[fig-yum-group]]
.Yum Configuration for the Hosted 'Releases' Repository
image::figs/web/yum-group.png[scale=50]

This configuration causes Nexus to merge the yum metadata of all
repositories in the repository group. Metadata generation has to be
configured for the individual repositories desired to be exposed as
part of the group. The URL of the repository group, can now be used as
the URL for a yum repository in the yum configuration, since the same
metadata files are being maintained and exposed via the +repodata+
context like in a hosted repository.

==== Scheduled Tasks

The yum support in Nexus includes a <<scheduled-tasks, scheduled
task>> called 'Yum: Generate Metadata' that can be run to generate yum
metadata with +createrepo+ for a specific repository.

Typically this task does not need to be run, however it can be
useful when RPM files already exist in a repository or are deployed in
some external mode that requires a manually triggered update of the
metadata.

The 'Optional Output Directory' parameter can be used to get the
metadata created in a different folder from the default +repo-data+ in
repository root.

The parameter 'Single RPM per directory' is activated by default and
causes the task to take only one RPM file per directory in the Maven
repository into account when creating the yum metadata. 

The 'Full Rebuild' parameter can be activated to force Nexus to
traverse all directories in the repository in order to find the RPM
files that need to taken into account for the metadata creation. This
option is off by default and causes Nexus to take the existing
metadata cache as a basis for the update.
 

[[yum-example-usage]]
=== Example Usages

The Nexus component upload to a hosted repository allows you to publish
any RPM file to a Maven repository and subsequently expose it
via the yum integration. This is a basic use case, that can be used
to e.g., exposed third-party supplied RPM archives. The more advanced
setup involves a Maven project that creates the RPM as detailed in
this section.

The http://mojo.codehaus.org/rpm-maven-plugin/[RPM Maven Plugin] can
be used to create an RPM package of a Java application and attach it
as a secondary built component with the +attached-rpm+ goal. An example
plugin configuration for a +war+ project can be found in
<<yum-rpm-pom>>.

If your project includes a +distributionManagement+ for the +releases+
repository, a build with +mvn clean deploy+, causes the +war+ as well
as the +rpm+ file to be uploaded to Nexus. With yum configured for the
+releases+ repository in Nexus, the RPM package can be consumed by any
server configured to access the repository with yum.

----

Now that Nexus hosts a RPM package with your Java web application in a
yum repository, you can configure yum on the target server to retrieve
it for installation. You have to configure yum to include the Nexus
repository as a package source. Depending on your specific Linux
distribution, file paths and tools for this configuration will
differ. A typical example would be to create a new file
e.g. +nexus.repo+ in +/etc/yum.repos.d+. A sample configuration for
the +public+ group can be found in <<nexus.repo>>.

[[nexus.repo]]
.Example yum source repository configuration
----
[nexus-public]
name=Nexus Releases Repository
baseurl=http://yournexusserverhost/nexus/content/groups/public
enabled=1
protect=0
gpgcheck=0
metadata_expire=30s
autorefresh=1
type=rpm-md 
----

Once the configuration is added you can install or update any RPM
packages from Nexus as usual with +yum install <packagename>+ or +yum
update <packagename>+.  This includes any required dependencies like a
servlet container or a Java runtime as declared in the RPM Maven
Plugin configuration and therefore the RPM/yum metadata.

[[yum-staging]]
=== Staging with RPMs

The <<staging, Nexus Staging Suite>> of Nexus Pro can be used
with yum repositories allowing you to optimize the release process for
your RPM packages.

The capability 'Yum: Staging Generate Metadata' allows you to
configure yum for a 'Staging Profile'. Any staging repository created
from a deployment via the staging profile is then automatically
configured as a yum repository. The 'Aliases' configuration allows for
the same mechanism as the capability 'Yum: Generate Metadata'
documented earlier.

The capability 'Yum: Staging Merge Metadata' can be used to configure
yum metadata creation for a build promotion profile and the attached
repository groups.

If a staging repository or build promotion repository is configured
for yum metadata generation and exposed via a repository group that is
configured for yum metadata merging, the metadata from staging will be
merged appropriately.
