== Repository Management with Nexus

=== About the Book

An introduction to repository management and the official documentation for http://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-oss[{oss}] 
and http://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-sonatype[{pro}].
 
The book is available in HTML and PDF format at http://www.sonatype.com/Support/Books/Repository-Management-with-Nexus

=== About this Project

This is the source code and build setup for the book. The content is
written in asciidoc format.  To edit asciidoc, use Emacs, vi, TextMate
or whatever other text editor you prefer.  You can even just preview
the files right in github and edit them on the web interface directly.

The main file for the book is

* book-nexus.asciidoc

which in turn includes a whole bunch of files named 

* chapter-*.asciidoc

These are all you should have to edit in terms of text content.

==== Figures and screenshots?  

Put them into figs/orig.

The rest is taken care of by the build.

==== Anything else? 

You'll see a lot of distracting files in that directory.  For now,
you should just ignore them.  Actually, in general, you'll notice a
number of distracting files in this project.  Really, just ignore
them or contact us directly if you need something.

==== How to Build the Book

I knew you'd ask that, and here's the simple answer (assumes Homebrew and OSX):

* Install python
----
$ brew install python
----
* Install asciidoc
----
$ brew install asciidoc
----
* Install the docbook xsl style sheets
----
$ brew install docbook
----
* Install a LaTeX distribution (Download 2.5GB package from https://www.tug.org/mactex/)
* Install dblatex
----
$ sudo easy_install pip
$ pip install dblatex
----
* Install imagemagick
----
$ brew link libpng
$ brew install imagemagick
----
* Run the build
----
$ ./build.sh
----
* After the build completes successfully, open the book in your browser
----
$ open ./target/book-nexus.html
----

Building is known to work on Mac OS X and Ubuntu. If you use something
else you might or might not end up in trouble.
