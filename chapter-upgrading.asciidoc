[[upgrade-introduction]]
=== Introduction

{nxrm} provides an upgrade tool with built-in functionality for replicating components and configurations from
{nxrm} version 2.14 to 3.1.

The core feature of this tool allows {nxrm} version 3 to talk to version 2. This is done through a capability
that communicates directly with the upgrade tool, and walks you through a customized upgrade method (i.e. plan).
The plan you create with version 3 will provide a wizard-like approach that guides you through an upgrade from
{nxrm} 2.14 or higher to {nxrm} 3.1 or higher.

While the tool will provide an easier path, there may be specific items unique to your installation and upgrade
needs. As with any major system upgrade or your organization should put strong emphasis on performance and
stability. If in doubt, Sonatype provide a number of support options including a detailed
https://support.sonatype.com/hc/en-us/sections/204911768-Installation-Upgrade-and-Compatibility[knowledge base
articles], and enterprise support for {pro} customers.


NOTE: This chapter will cover a special feature used to upgrade from {nxrm} 2.14 to 3.1. However, the repository 
manager provides alternative methods to upgrade if you are currently running older versions of 3, all the way 
back to milestone 7. See our support knowledge base to walk you through the steps to upgrade from 
https://support.sonatype.com/hc/en-us/articles/222159808[milestone 7 of version 3 to 3.0.0 final] or 
https://support.sonatype.com/hc/en-us/articles/217967608[version 3.0.0 to a later version].


[[what-is-upgraded]]
=== What Is Upgraded?

Upgrading versions of {nxrm} represents a shift in design that was needed to support a wider set of requirements
customers have requested. As such, a number of changes occur as part of the upgrade process. This includes:

* Coverting Component Files to Blobs - Components ( artifacts) in Nexus 2 are stored as individual files on disk.
  Nexus 3 stores components as blobs. The conversion process requires Nexus to iterate over every component in
  your storage and this will take the bulk of the time required for upgrade.
* Moving Settings and Metadata to a Database - Settings and some component metadata in {nxrm} 2.x are stored
  across many files. Conversely, {nxrm} 3.x loads equivalent settings into an OrientDB database.
* Replacing Settings in the target {nxrm} 3.x installation - The upgrade process does not merge settings, instead
  it completely replaces the related settings in {nxrm} 3.

[[upgrade-repo-support]]
==== Repository Format Support

Below is a list of repositories available in version 2 and 3 and which are supported by upgrading. For each of 
these formats you can upgrade server-wide settings, security realm settings, and repository content.

* npm
* NuGet
* Site/Raw
* Maven2

[[upgrade-architecture]]
==== Supported Installation Scenarios for Upgrading

There are two supported scenarios for upgrading:

* Separate version 2 and version 3 servers
* Both versions of 2 and 3 running on the same server, in different service locations

[[upgrade-process-expectations]]
==== Upgrade Process and Expectations

While version 2 is active, repository content will be added, updated, and deleted as the upgrade continues 
within version 3. Version 3 will pick up these changes. However, configuration changes such as new 
repositories, realm settings, permissions, roles and role assignments, HTTP configuration, and SSL certificates 
should not be changed. After the upgrade starts such changes will not be picked up by version 3 and may result 
in failure.

[[upgrade-methods]]
=== Upgrade Methods

In order to start an upgrade, version 2 has to listen for version 3 to initiate communication. When the upgrade
tool in version 3 helps you build an upgrade plan, it talks to your version 2 instance in order to find out what
repositories exist (e.g. to list them in the wizard user interface). 

When you pick the repositories to be upgraded, version 3 uses these selections to tell version 2 to start
compiling a full list of what it has that needs replicating in each of those repositories. Ultimately, this
creates a scheduled task that walks through the repository storage folder, lists the files, then synchronizes
them, storing the metadata in the changelog database.

On the version 3 side, components are stored as blobs. The conversion process requires version 3 to iterate over 
every component in your storage.

Once both repository manager instances are stood up and communicating, you can consider one of three ingestion
methods (listed below). The choice of ingestion method can be made on a repository-by-repository basis, but there
is an upgrade-wide default.

////
Expand on what types of architectures might benefit from the listed options
////

*HTTP Downloading*

HTTP downloading is an ingestion method in which version 3 will make HTTP requests to version 2. This is the 
slowest option for upgrading.

If {nxrm} 2.x and {nxrm} 3.x are on different machines and do not share access to the same file system storage, 
you must use the HTTP download method.

*File System Copying*

If versions 2 and 3 are on the same machine (or share access to the same file systems) then version 3 will 
copy the files from version 2. Version 2 will tell version 3 the location of the file and where to retrieve the 
content. 

Assuming versions 2 and 3 are on the same machine, configured in a way that the mounts are accessible by the same 
path (from one machine to the other) this option will work. It is a slightly faster process than the download 
method, and has less impact on the performance of version 2.

*Hard Linking*

This method only works on the same file system. If you want to hard link, configure your instance of version 3 in 
such a way that you have a blob store defined in an appropriate location where hard linking is possible.

This is the fastest option because you will not have to move the bytes around.

[[upgrade-prep]]
==== Preparing for an Upgrade

If you decide to upgrade, the most critical decisions you or your organization make around the upgrade method
chosen should include:

* What ingestion methods are available to you
* Where components will be transferred when the upgrade is complete
* Which of the two installation scenarios is best for your upgrade method
* Identification of a maintenance window for version 2 to allow the upgrade to proceed without interruption
* Required system storage

In addition, the following items and settings should be reviewed:

////

Intro paragraph needed.

////

*Repository IDs*

Before migrating repositories to version 3, find the repository IDs in version 2 and plan how you will 
rename any conflicting repositories in version 3. Contact our https://support.sonatype.com/hc/en-us[support 
team] to learn on how to do this safely.

*Repository Groups*

Review the contents of your repository groups. If empty, the upgrade plan will not permit transfer, as validation 
will fail.

*User Tokens*

The upgrade tool can only replicate pre-existing user tokens from version 2 to 3 if the 'Enabled' box in version 
2 is checked. In version 2, click the 'User Token' tab, in the 'Administration' menu, and enable the setting. 


*Repository Health Check and SSL Health Check*

You can include both your existing {rhc} and its corresponding SSL trust store configuration when you upgrade 
from version 2 to version 3. If you are a {oss} user you only have the ability to upgrade your settings from the 
'Health Check: Configuration' capability. If you run {pro}, you can also upgrade your existing 'SSL: Health 
Check' settings in version 2 to version 3. After the upgrade is complete settings for both 'Health Check: 
Configuration' and 'SSL: Health Check' capabilities will be enabled in version 3, as they were in version 2.

*Repository Targets and Target Privileges*

If upgrading your Repository Targets from version 2 to version 3, it is recommended you also upgrade your Target 
Privileges and vice versa.  If you do not upgrade both, you may find that you need to make further adjustments to 
version 3 configuration to have things work as they did in version 2.

[[upgrade-security]]
==== Security and Upgrade

////

*NuGet API Key*

The upgrade tool will add all keys to {nxrm} 3 that are present in {nxrm} 2.14 when asked, even if the version 2 
NuGet API Key Realm is not active. This is because there is no explicit on or off setting for NuGet keys.

////
NO IQ Server capability in 3.1

*IQ Server*

{inrmonly}

If upgrading {iq} settings and configuration, ensure that your licenses include the integration for both versions 
2 and 3. Your configuration for 'IQ Server URL', 'Username', 'Password', and 'Request Timeout' will be included 
in the upgrade. Additional configuration, such as analysis properties, trust store usage, and the enabled {iq} 
connection itself will be replicated from versions 2 to 3.
////

[[upgrade-performance]]
==== Performance and Tuning for Upgrading

When considering upgrade time and speed, take into account all enabled scheduled tasks on your version 2 instance
that you may not need. Depending on your configuration of version 2 you could optimize the performance of the
application by:

* Disabling system feeds
* Disabling repair tasks
* Reviewing the Custom Metadata capability (when enabled)
* Removing unused snapshots
* Removing old scheduled tasks not in use
* Removing repositories no longer supported by the repository manager (e.g. 
https://support.sonatype.com/hc/en-us/articles/217611787-codehaus-org-Repositories-Should-Be-Removed-From-Your-Nexus-Instance[Codehaus repositories])
* Disabling 'Rebuild Maven Metadata Files' scheduled tasks
* Increasing your file size limit

NOTE: The quality of your network, can impact the speed of ingestion methods (e.g HTTP download).

[[upgrade-file-systems]]
==== File System Considerations

Components in {nxrm} 2.x are stored as individual files on disk, while {nxrm} 3,x stores components as blobs. The
conversion process requires the repository manager to iterate every component in your storage. This process will
take the bulk of the time required for upgrading. While discussed in greater detail in
<<admin-repository-blobstores,Chapter 4>>, {nxrm} 3.x does allow you to create new blob stores and determine the
amount of space for each, if more than one exists. However, it is important to consider how you want to organize
this storage mechanism, and the differences in previous versions of {nxrm}.

When upgrading, make sure you have enough storage capacity in the destined file system(s). For instance, if you
are using the hard linking <<upgrade-methods,method>>, the bytes themselves are not duplicated (saving space),
but you must ensure there are enough free inodes for the content you want to transfer during upgrade.

On a final note, if you have configured your repository manager HTTP context, and path as a reverse proxy server,
the traffic coming from version 2 could be busy as you start the upgrade steps. 

NOTE: HTTP download ingestion puts more load on your version 2 instance than other ingestion methods, because 
this method requires version 2 to serve all of the content. Copying and hard linking only have to be told where 
the file is, and they obtain it from the file system, directly.

[[upgrade-start]]
=== Starting the Upgrade

After considerations around system performance and storage are taken into account, there are a few basic steps 
to start the upgrade:

* Upgrade the {nxrm} 2.x to version 2.14 or higher, and configure the upgrade capability that allows 
you to synchronize that instance with {nxrm} 3.1 or later.
* Run 2.14 or later on one server, and version 3.1 or later on another non-conflicting server.
* Configure the migration-agent in version 2 and start the upgrade wizard in version 3.

{nxrm} 3.1 provides a tool to instruct you through upgrading in three phases:

 * 'Preparing', the phase that prepares the transfer and creation of all components.
 * 'Synchronizing', the phase that counts and processes all components set to upgrade.
 * 'Finishing', the phase that performs final clean up, then closes the process.

To execute the upgrade plan you must open the connection between version 2 and 3. The connection finds what 
repositories exist and lists them in the upgrade wizard. It enables the port you configured to run version 2 
remotely in order to communicate with version 3. The upgrade plan, as a whole, is a two-part process where 
version 2 must be set up to listen for a version 3 instance in order for the former to talk to the latter.

[[upgrade-configuration]]
==== Enabling Upgrade in Version 2

In version 2, activate the 'Migration: Agent' capability to open the connection for the migration-agent. Follow 
these steps:

* Click 'Administration' in the left-hand panel
* Open the 'Capabilities' screen
* Select 'New' to prompt the 'Create new capability' modal
* Select 'Migration: Agent' as your capability 'Type'
* Click 'Add' to close the modal

In the lower section of the 'Capabilities' interface, the repository manager acknowledges the migration-agent as 
'Active'. 

[[upgrade-plan]]
==== Enabling Upgrade in Version 3

Next, sign in to your version 3 instance. You will create a 'Migration' capability to enable the feature. When 
enabled, the 'Migration' item appears in the 'Administration' menu, under 'System'. Follow these steps to 
activate the capability:

* Click 'System', to open the 'Capabilities' screen
* Click 'Create capability'
* Select 'Migration', then click 'Create capability' to enable the upgrade

[[upgrade-content]]
==== Upgrading Content

After you establish upgrade capabilities for versions 2 and 3, you will activate the tool to start your 
upgrade. In version 3 go to the 'Administration' menu and select 'Migration', located under 'System'.

Overview:: The tool provides an overview of what is allowed for an upgrade as well as warnings on what 
cannot be upgraded.

Agent Connection:: This screen presents two fields, 'URL' and 'Access Token'. The 'URL' field should contain the
base URL (including context path) of your version 2 server (e.g. +http://localhost:8081/nexus/+). The 'Access 
Token' field should contain the security key from your version 2 'Migration: Agent' capability details.

Content:: This screen displays checkboxes for compatible component formats ('Repositories'), security features 
('Security'), and server configuration ('System'). For 'Repositories' you can select 'User-Managed Repositories', 
'Repository Targets', and 'Health Check'. For 'Security' you can choose from 'Anonymous', 'LDAP Configuration', 
'NuGet API-Key', 'Realms', 'Roles', 'SSL Certificates', 'Target Privileges', 'Users', 'Crowd', and 'User Tokens'. 
For 'System' you can select 'Email', 'HTTP Configuration', and 'IQ Server' configurations.

NOTE: Repository targets, which use regular expressions to match and filter specific content will upgrade to JEXL 
syntax, used for <<content-selectors,content selectors>>.

Repository Defaults:: If 'User-Managed Repositories' is one of your selections from the 'Content' screen, the 
'Repository Defaults' screen allows you to select directory destination and upgrade method. The first dropdown 
menu, 'Destination' gives your option to pick a blob store name different than the default. The second dropdown
menu, 'Method', allows you to choose among hard linking, copying local files or downloading. This section allows 
you to click and change each repository's individual method and destination (i.e. blob store).

Repositories:: If 'User-Managed Repositories' is one of your selections from the 'Content' screen, the 
'Repositories' screen allows you to select which repositories you want to upgrade. You can either select all 
repositories with one click, at the top of the table. Alternatively, you can click each individual repository. In 
addition to 'Repository', the table displays information around the status of the repository.

Preview:: This table displays a preview of the content set for upgrade, selected in the previous screens. 
Click 'Begin', then confirm from the modal, that you want to start the upgrade. After the preview 'Preparing', 
'Synchronizing', and 'Finishing' will follow.

When the final content upgrade ends, go to your version 3 instance to see all your content replicated there.
