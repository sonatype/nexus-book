== Using the User Interface

[[using-introduction]]
=== Introduction

This chapter covers the basic aspects of the user interface of {pro} and {oss} applicable for read-only access
including an overview of the user interface features, searching components and browsing repositories and other
features that are, by default, available to anonymous users and similar read-only roles.

Administrative tasks like configuring repositories, task, security and many other aspects are documented in
<<admin>>.

[[using-sect-intro]]
=== User Interface Overview
{inall}

The user interface is used with a web browser and works best with modern browsers. Older versions such as
Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 or earlier are not supported and actively blocked from using the repository manager
user interface to avoid an unsatisfactory user experience.

The repository manager provides anonymous access for users who only need to search for components, browse the
repositories and access components via client tools such as Maven or NuGet. This anonymous access level is a
configurable, read-only mode that includes the main user interface elements as shown in
<<fig-ui-overview-anonymous>>.

[[fig-ui-overview-anonymous]]
.User Interface for Anonymous Users
image::figs/web/ui-overview-anonymous.png[scale=60]

Once a user is logged in further features become available depending on the user's privileges. An example for the
'admin' user including the 'Administration' menu icon is visible in <<fig-ui-overview-admin>>.

[[fig-ui-overview-admin]]
.User Interface for Logged In 'admin' User
image::figs/web/ui-overview-admin.png[scale=60]

The user interface is separated into a number of different sections.

Main toolbar::

The top of the page contains the header with a number of elements starting on the left with the logo:

Logo and version label;; The logo and the version label differ for {oss} and {pro} and allows you to know what
version of the repository manager you are accessing at a glance.

Browse button image:figs/web/ui-browse-button-icon.png[scale=50];; The browse button allows you to switch to the
'Browse' menu items in the main menu section on the left of the user interface. The contents of the menu will
depend on your assigned user privileges.

Administration button image:figs/web/ui-admin-button-icon.png[scale=50];; The administration button allows to
 switch to the 'Administration' menu items in the main menu section on the left of the user interface as visible
 in <<fig-ui-overview-admin>>. The contents of the menu will depend on your assigned user privileges.

Search input box;; The search input box can be used to start a keyword search. The results are displayed in the
feature view panel.

Refresh button image:figs/web/ui-refresh-button-icon.png[scale=50];; The refresh button is a global refresh button
that affects all views in the user interface including the feature view panel. E.g., it refreshes the search
results view, the user list or the staging repository list, if they are currently the active feature view.

Help button image:figs/web/ui-help-button-icon.png[scale=50];; Clicking the help button opens up the help menu.
 It contains a link to specific help about the currently active feature view. The 'About' item displays a dialog
 with details about the version as well as license and copyright information. The 'Documentation', 'Knowledge
 base', 'Community', 'Issue tracker' and 'Support' items link to the respective pages on the Sonatype websites.

Sign In image:figs/web/ui-sign-in-icon.png[scale=50] and user account/signout buttons
image:figs/web/ui-user-account-icon.png[scale=50];; The 'Sign In' button allows you to sign into the user
interface as a specific user. Doing so gives you access to the privileges assigned to the user and toggles the
button to display the user name work as access button to the 'Account' feature view as part of the 'User' menu in
the main menu on the left. In addition the sign out button will be displayed.

Main Menu::

The main menu on the left contains either the 'Browse', the 'Administration' or the 'User' menu items. The exact
list of available menu items depends on the current user's assigned privileges. E.g., the 'Administration' menu as
visible in <<fig-ui-overview-admin>> includes the 'Security' section, which is not available to anonymous users by
default.  The panel itself can be horizontally collapsed and expanded with the button in the top right-hand corner
of the panel. Each submenu can be vertically collapsed and expanded with the button beside the title for each
submenu. Selecting a menu item triggers the display of the respective feature view in the feature view panel.

Feature View Panel::

The feature view panel in the center of the user interface right of the main menu initially displays the 'Welcome'
feature view. It changes display based on your selected item in the main menu.

<<fig-ui-example>> shows a typical user interface appearance of the repository manager with the 'Users' feature
view in the feature view panel. It shows a list of users.

[[fig-ui-example]]
.Typical Example Interface with a List
image::figs/web/ui-example.png[scale=40]

Clicking on a row in the list, switches the feature view to a specific display for the item in the row as visible
in <<fig-ui-example-view>>. The top level navigation allows you get back to the list by clicking on the 'Users'
label. The form below has a number of sections that can be accessed via buttons as well as specific functionality
like deletion and their associated buttons.

[[fig-ui-example-view]]
.Typical Example Interface for Editing and Viewing 
image::figs/web/ui-example-view.png[scale=40]

The list header features buttons for various operations that differ per list as well as an input box that allows
you to filter the list by any terms used in any column. <<fig-ui-list-filtering>> shows an example use case where
a user typed "Hosted" in the filter box and the list of repositories only shows hosted repositories. This
filtering works for all columns in a list and can be used in most list displays in the repository manager. For
example you can use it to filter the users list to find disabled users, filter the routing list, the roles list
and many more.


[[fig-ui-list-filtering]]
.Filtering the Repository List to Display Only Hosted Repositories
image::figs/web/ui-list-filtering.png[scale=50]

The column headers in most lists can be clicked to invoke a sorting of the list by the respective column as well as
activate and deactivate specific columns.


[[search-components]]
=== Searching for Components
{inall}

Searching components in the repository manager is an important use case for being able to access information about
specific components including different versions that are available, security and license data and other
information as well as for build tool migrations, download of deployment packages and other component related
development, QA and operations activities.

The different search modes can be accessed with the 'Browse' button in the main toolbar and selecting 'Search' or
one of the nested options like 'Custom', 'Maven' and others. The common feature view with the criteria drop-down
selector for the search without results is displayed in <<fig-search>>.

[[fig-search]]
.Keyword Search with 'Format' and 'More criteria' Input
image::figs/web/search.png[scale=40]

Beneath the search title is the search criteria input area that displays the current criteria input e.g.,
'Keyword'. Beside the current criteria is a 'More Criteria' button that allows you to add further criteria to your
search. Each criteria can be removed by clicking on the minus/dash icon within the criteria input box. The cross/x in
the input box resets the value.  In <<fig-search>> you can see the 'Format' criteria added to the search.

Each criteria can be used with a search term and supports the * character (star, asterisk) for pattern matching. E.g.,
you could search with the 'Group' search criteria and search for +org.sonatype.nexus.*+. This would return components
with the group of +org.sonatype.nexus+, but also +org.sonatype.nexus.plugins+ and many others.

====  Search Criteria and Component Attributes

A number of criteria can be used with any repository format and returns results from all components in all repositories:
 
Keyword:: A keyword is a string used for a search, where matches in 'Format', 'Group', 'Name', 'Version' and all other
component metadata values are returned.

Format:: The format of the repository in which to look for a component. E.g. {OSS} supports `maven2`, `docker`,`nuget`
and `raw`.

Group:: An identifier that groups components in some way, such as by organization. It can also be used to simply to
create a specific namespace for a project. Not all repository formats use the notion of a group. Some tools simply use a
different name for the concept e.g., +org+ for Apache Ivy or `groupId` for Apache Maven and the 'maven2' repository
format. In the case of a maven2 repository, group is a required attribute. Other formats, like the 'nuget' repository
format, do not use group at all.

Name:: The name of a component constitutes its main identifier. Different repository formats use a different name
for the concept such as `artifactId` for Apache Maven and the 'maven2' repository format.

Version:: The version of a component allows you to have different points in time of a component released. Various
tools such as Maven or NuGet use the term version. Other build systems call this differently e.g. +rev+, short for
revision, in the case of Apache Ivy. In most repository formats version numbers are not enforced to follow a
specific standard and are simply a string. This affects the sort order and can produce unexpected results.

Checksum - MD5, SHA-1 or SHA-512:: A checksum value of a component file generated by an MD5, SHA-1 or SHA-512
algorithm.

In addition there are criteria that can be used to search for components in repositories with specific formats
only:

Maven Repositories::

Group Id;; The Maven +groupId+ for a component. Other build systems supporting the Maven repository format call
this differently e.g. +org+ for Apache Ivy and +group+ for Gradle and Groovy Grape. 'Group Id' is equivalent to
'Group'.

Artifact Id;; The Maven +artifactId+ for a component. Other build systems call this differently e.g. +name+ for
Apache Ivy and Gradle, and +module+ for Groovy Grape.  'Artifact Id' is equivalent to 'Name'.

Classifier;; The Maven 'classifier' for a component. Common values are +javadoc+, +sources+ or +tests+.

Packaging;; The Maven +packaging+ for a component, which is +jar+ by default. Other values as used in Maven and
other build tools are +ear+, +war+, +maven-plugin+, +pom+, +ejb+, +zip+, +tar.gz+, +aar+ and many others.

Base Version;; The base version of the component/asset. Typically this is the same value as the version for
release components. `SNAPSHOT` development components use a time-stamped version but the base version uses the
`SNAPSHOT` version e.g.  version of `1.0.0-20151001.193253-1` and base version of `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`.

Extension;; The extension used for a specific asset of a component.

npm Repositories::

Additional criteria for component searches in 'npm Repositories' are:

Group;; The npm 'Group' is equivalent to the component group, also sometimes referred to as scope by npm users.

Name;; The npm 'Name' is equivalent to the component version.

Version;; The npm 'Version' is equivalent to the component version.


NuGet Repositories::

ID;; The NuGet component identifier is known as `Package ID` to NuGet users.

Tags;; Additional information about a component formatted as space-delimited keywords, chosen by the package
author.

Docker Repositories::

Image Name;; The name for the Docker image. It is equivalent to the 'Name' of the component in the repository
manager that represents the Docker image.

Image Tag;; The tag for the Docker image. It is equivalent to the 'Version' of the component in the repository
manager that represents the Docker image.

Layer Id;; The unique identifier for a Docker image layer. It is equivalent to the 'layerId' attribute of the
component in the repository manager that represents the Docker image.

Raw Repositories:: 

Searches in 'Raw Repositories' can be narrowed down with the 'Path' criteria. It allows you to specify a file path
to the components in the raw repository. The search can return all components or files with the respective path
pattern.

==== Search Results

Once you have provided your search terms in one or multiple criteria input fields, like the 'Keywords' criteria in
the 'Search' feature view, the results become visible in the component list, with an example displayed in
<<fig-search-results>>. The components are listed with their 'Name', 'Group', 'Version', 'Format', 'Repository',
'Age' and 'Popularity' information and are sorted alphabetically by 'Name'.  Columns and sort order can be
adjusted like in all other lists.

[[fig-search-results]]
.Results of an Component Search for +junit+
image::figs/web/search-results.png[scale=35]


The 'Age' column displays the age of the component.  The age of a component is typically calculated from the
initial release to a repository -- typically a public repository such as the Central Repository. Since most Java
components are published to the Central Repository when released, this age gives you a good indication of the
actual time since the release of the component. For other repository formats and related upstream public
repositories the availability of data may differ.

The 'Popularity' column shows a relative popularity as compared to the other component versions. This can give you
a good idea on the adoption rate of a new release. For example if a newer version has a high age value, but a low
popularity compared to an older version, you might want to check the upstream project and see if there is any
issues stopping other users from upgrading that might affect you as well. Another reason could be that the new
version does not provide significant improvements to warrant an upgrade for most users.


Selecting a component in the list changes to a display of the component information documented in
<<component-information>>.

////

The 'Security Issues' column shows the number of known security issues for the specific component. The 'License
Threat' column shows a coloured square with blue indicating no license threat and yellow, orange and red
indicating increased license threats. More information about both indicators can be seen in the 'Component Info'
panel below the list of components for the specific component.

////

==== Preconfigured Searches

Keyword Search::

The main toolbar includes a 'Search components' text input field.  Type your search term and press 'enter' and the
repository manager performs a search by 'Keyword'.
+
The same search can be accessed by selecting the 'Search' item in the 'Browse' main menu. The search term can be
provided in the 'Keyword' input field in the 'Search' feature view.

Custom Search::

A configurable search using the criteria you select is available via the 'Custom' menu item in the 'Search'
section of the 'Browse' main menu. Initially it has no criteria and it allows you to create a search with criteria
you add with the 'More Criteria' button.

Bower Search::

The 'Bower' search is a predefined search available via the 'Bower' menu item in the 'Search' section of the
'Browse' menu. It defaults to inputs for 'Name' and 'Version' and supports adding further criteria. The format is
configured to 'bower'.

Docker Search::

The 'Docker' search is a predefined search available via the 'Docker' menu item in the 'Search' section of the
'Browse' main menu. It defaults to inputs for 'Image Name', 'Image Tag' and 'Layer Id' and supports adding further
criteria. The format is configured to 'docker'.

Maven Search:: 

The 'Maven' search is a predefined search available via the 'Maven' menu item in the 'Search' section of the
'Browse' main menu. It defaults to inputs for 'Group Id', 'Artifact Id', 'Version', 'Base Version', 'Classifier'
and 'Extension' and supports adding further criteria. The format is configured to 'maven2'.

NuGet Search::

The 'NuGet' search is a predefined search available via the 'NuGet' menu item in the 'Search' section of the
'Browse' main menu. It defaults to inputs for 'ID' and 'Tags' and supports adding further criteria. The format is
configured to 'nuget'.

npm Search::

The 'npm' search is a predefined search available via the 'npm' menu item in the 'Search' section of the 'Browse'
main menu. It defaults to inputs for 'Scope', 'Name' and 'Version' and supports adding further criteria.

Raw Search::

The 'Raw' search is a predefined search available via the 'Raw' menu item in the 'Search' section of the 'Browse'
main menu. It defaults to an input for 'Path' and supports adding further criteria. The format is configured to
'raw'.

==== Example Use Case - SHA-1 Search

Sometimes it is necessary to determine the version of a component, where you only have access to the binary file
without any detailed component information. When attempting this identification and neither the filename nor the
contents of the file contain any useful information about the exact version of the component, you can use 'SHA-1'
search to identify the component.

Create a sha1 checksum, e.g., with the +sha1sum+ command available on Linux or OSX or +fciv+ on Windows, and use
the created string in a 'Custom' search by adding the 'SHA-1' criteria from the 'Checksum' section of the 'More
criteria' control.

The search will return a result, which will provide you with the detailed information about the file allowing you
to replace the file with a dependency declaration. E.g. you can derive the Maven coordinates of a jar file and use
them in a dependency declaration.

TIP: A SHA-1 or similar checksum search can be a huge timesaver when migrating from a legacy build system, where
the used libraries are checked into the version control system as binary components with no version information
available.


[[browse-browse]]
=== Browsing Repositories and Repository Groups
{inall}

One of the most straightforward uses of the repository manager is to browse the contents of a repository or a
repository group. Browsing allows you to inspect the contents of any repository or repository group for all the
supported repository formats.

Click on the Browse button image:figs/web/ui-browse-button-icon.png[scale=50] in the main toolbar to access the 'Browse'
menu and the 'Components' and 'Assets' menu items. The 'Component' as well as the 'Assets' feature views allowing you to
select a repository or repository group to browse from the list of all repositories as displayed in
<<fig-browse-components-repos>>.

[[fig-browse-components-repos]]
.List of Repositories to Access for Component Browsing
image::figs/web/browse-components-repos.png[scale=50]

Once you clicked on the row for a specific repository a list of components in the repository is displayed. It uses the
same columns as the search results displayed in <<fig-search-results>>. You can filter the list content, change the rows
and select ordering.

[[component-information]]
=== Viewing Component Information
{inall}

Once you located a component by browsing a repository or via a search and selected it in the list, you see the 
component information and a list of associated assets. An example is displayed in <<fig-component-details>>.

The information displayed includes the name and format of the repository that contains the component as well as
the component identifiers 'Group', 'Name' and 'Version'. 'Most popular version' contains the version number of the
same component that is most popular in its usage within a specific group and name. 'Popularity' shows a relative
percentage of popularity between the displayed component against all other versions of this component. A value of
100% signals this version to be the most popular. 50% means that the specific version is half as popular as the
most popular version.Popularity data is provided by the {ds} based on requests from the Central Repository and
other data and not available for all components. 'Age' shows the age of the component.

None of the popularity or age data is viewable without {rhc} enabled.  For more details on {rhc} see <<rhc>>.

A list of one or more assets associated with the component is shown below the component information. Click on the 
row with the 'Name' of the asset you want to inspect to view the asset information documented in 
<<asset-information>>.

[[fig-component-details]]
.Example for Component Information and List of Associated Assets
image::figs/web/component-details.png[scale=35]

To delete a component press the 'Delete component' button as shown in <<fig-component-details>>. A modal will pop
up to confirm the deletion. You can only delete components from hosted and proxy repositories. A deletion of a
components triggers the deletion of all its associated assets, in most repository formats.

NOTE: In some repository formats assets are shared across component and these remain after deletion a component
deletion. For example, while a Docker image is a component and can be deleted, the layers that make it up remain
after its deletion as these assets are potentially shared with other Docker images. 

[[asset-information]]
=== Viewing Asset Information
{inall}

Asset information can be accessed by browsing assets directly or from a component information view. The 
'Delete' button allows you to remove an asset. The information itself is broken up into two sections, 
accessable by tabs below the 'Delete'  button.

The 'Info' section contains a number of attributes about the specific asset.  An example is displayed in <<fig-asset-info>>.

Path:: the path to the asset in the repository
Content type:: the MIME type of the asset
File size:: the size of the file in KB
Last updated:: the date and time when the asset was last updated
Last accessed:: the date and time when the asset was last accessed
Locally cached:: set to 'true' if the asset can be found in the repository manager storage, 'false' indicates that
the metadata about the asset is available, while the asset itself has not been downloaded
Blob reference:: a unique identifier pointing at the the binary blob representing the asset in the repository
manager storage

[[fig-asset-info]]
.Asset Info Example
image::figs/orig/asset-info.png[scale=80]

The 'Attributes' section contains further metadata about the asset related to 'Cache', 'Checksum' and
'Content_attributes'.  An example is displayed in <<fig-asset-attributes>>.

Assets can include format specific attributes displayed in additional sections. For example an asset in a Maven2
repository has a 'Maven2' section with attributes for 'extension', 'baseVersion', 'groupId', 'artifactId', 
'version' and 'asset_kind'.

[[using-sect-uploading]]
=== Uploading Maven Artifacts 
{inall}

When your build makes use of proprietary or custom dependencies that are not available from public repositories,
you will often need to find a way to make them available to developers in a custom Maven repository. The
repository manager ships with a preconfigured third-party repository that was designed to hold third-party
dependencies that are used in your builds.

If you are signed in as a user with sufficient privileges, the 'Upload' section of the 'Browse' main menu will be
visible and contain the 'Maven' menu item. Press on this item and the feature view panel will display the 'Maven'
feature as shown in <<fig-using-artifact-upload>>.

[[fig-using-artifact-upload]]
.Maven Artifact Upload Feature
image::figs/web/using_artifact-upload.png[scale=50]

To upload a component, select the target repository from the 'Repository' drop down list and press the 'Add an artifact'
button and select the component you want to upload from the filesystem in the dialog.

Once you have selected an component, you can modify the 'Classifier' and the 'Extension', if they have not been
pre-filled automatically.

If the component you want to upload is a POM file, you can press the 'Upload' button to complete the upload.

If you do not have a POM file and are uploading e.g., a JAR file you have to ensure to specify the 'Group', 'Artifact' ,
'Version' and 'Packaging' values to be able to proceed and then press the 'Upload' button. Packaging values can be
selected from the drop down list or provided by typing the value into the input box.

In both cases you can upload multiple components for the same coordinates e.g., the POM and the JAR file, with the 'Add
another artifact' button. This allows you to upload a POM and a JAR file combined with the sources and javadoc JAR files
in one operation.

[[fig-using-artifact-upload-details]]
.Maven Artifact Upload Feature
image::figs/web/using_artifact-upload-details.png[scale=50]

If you added a POM file as an additional component the coordinates from the POM file will be used the and input filed
will be removed.

TIP: Uploading a POM file allows you to add further details like dependencies to the file, which improves the quality of
the upload by enabling transitive dependency management.

[[using-sect-user-profile]]
=== Working with Your User Profile
{inall}

As a logged-in user, you can click on your user name on the right-hand side of the main toolbar to switch the main menu
to contain the 'User' menu. Pressing on the 'Account' menu item displays the 'Account' feature in the main feature panel
as displayed in <<fig-account-feature-panel>>.

[[fig-account-feature-panel]]
.Editing User Details in the Account Feature Panel 
image::figs/web/account-feature-panel.png[scale=50]

The 'Account' feature allows you to edit your 'First Name', 'Last Name', and 'Email' directly in the form.

==== Changing Your Password

In addition to changing your name and email, the user profile allows you to change your password by clicking on the
'Change Password' button. You will be prompted to authenticate with your current password and subsequently supply your
new password in pop up dialogs.

TIP: The password change feature only works with the built-in security realm. If you are using a different
security realm like LDAP or Crowd, this option will not be visible.
