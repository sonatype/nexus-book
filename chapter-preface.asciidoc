icons, showing in which edition the specific features are available:

{in} {oss}, {pro}, {proplus}

If you can not find any specific mentions of Nexus edition, it is safe
to assume that the feature can be found in all editions. Keep in mind
that {proplus} is an extension of {pro}, which in turn is an extension
of {oss}.

.Conventions Used in the Documentation

A number of convetions are used through out the documentation to
simplify following the instructions and content.

A user interface label or button is highlighted. E.g. use the
'Applications' button to access the list of applications in the CLM
server.

A code segment or command line like +mvn clean install+ input in a
paragraph uses monospace fonts just like they would be used in a
command line window.

Larger code segments use the same monospace fonts and are encapsulated
in a block:
