== Nexus Procurement Suite

[[procure-sect-intro]]
=== Introduction

Nexus Procurement Suite provides an organization with control over
what components are allowed into a repository from an external, proxied
repository such as the Central Repository. Such control can be a
prerequisite for organizations unwilling or unable to trust the entire
contents of an external public repository. If an organization is
developing mission critical code, they will likely want to subject
every third party dependency to intense scrutiny and testing before
making the component available to build a release or support a team of
developers. In most Enterprise development environments, a developer
can't just decide to add in a new dependency to Hibernate or to the
Spring Framework on a whim; the decision to add dependencies to
third-party libraries will need to be funnelled through an oversight
process that relies on an architect or an administrator to promote
components to a certified release repository.

Another, more common experience is an organization which needs to
proxy something like the Central Repository, but wants to limit
access to specific versions of components or prevent dependencies on
everything contained under a specific group. Some organizations are
more amenable to trusting the contents of a remote, proxied repository
like the Central Repository, but they also need the ability to block certain
dependencies.  Maybe you work on a team that needs to limit access to
dependencies with a certain license, or maybe you just want to make
sure no one uses a problematic version of Hibernate with a known bug?
The procurement suite is the tool that provides for both coarse and
fine-grained control of the artifacts that can appear in a repository.

[[procure-sect-stages]] 
=== The Stages of Procurement

A procured repository is a hosted Repository which procures components
from a Proxy Repository, while procurement is enabled. For example,
one could create a hosted repository named "Approved From Central" and then
configure this hosted repository to procure components from the
"Central" repository. Once the hosted repository has been created and
the source of procurement has been configured, the repository will
obtain components from the proxy repository as long as procurement is
activated.  If you start procurement for a hosted repository, the
hosted repository will fetch artifacts from the proxy repository
specified in the procurement settings. If you stop procurement for a
hosted repository, no additional components will be retrieved from the
proxy repository specified in the procurement settings. Without
procurement active it is a plain, static hosted repository.

The ability to enable or disable procurement for a hosted repository
comes in very handy when you want to "certify" a hosted repository as
containing all of the components (no more and no less) required for a
production build. You can start procurement, run a build which
triggers artifact procurement, and then stop procurement knowing that
the procured repository now contains all of the components required
for building a specific project. Stopping procurement assures you that
the contents of the repository will not change if the third-party,
external proxied repository does. This is an extra level of assurance
that your release components depend on a set of components under your
complete control.

[[procure-sect-approaches]]
=== Two Approaches to Procurement

There are two main use cases for the Procurement Suite. In the first
use case, the 'Procured Release Repository', the procurement features
are used to create a procured release repository to make sure that the
organization has full control over the components that are making it
into a production release. The other use case, the 'Procured
Development Repository', is for organizations that need more up-front
control over which artifacts are allowed during the development of a
project. The following sections describe these two uses cases in more
detail.

 [[procure-sect-cert]] 
==== Procured Release Repository

The Procurement Suite can be used in two different ways.  In the
"Procured Release" mode, developers work with a proxied 3rd party
repository exactly as they would without the Procurement Suite.  When
a developer needs to add a dependency on a new artifact, Nexus will
retrieve the artifact from the third-party repository (like Central or
Apache Snapshots) and this artifact will be served to Maven via a
proxied Nexus repository. When a QA or Release engineer needs to build
a release or staging artifact, the Release or QA build would be
configured to execute against a procured repository or repository
group with only approved and procured repositories. A procured
repository is one which only serves the components which have been
explicitly approved using the Procurement Suite.

.Procurement to a Certified Release Repository
image::figs/web/procurement_release-procurement.png[scale=60]

In this model, developers can add as many third-party dependencies as
they want, and it is the responsibility of the QA and release
engineers to approve (or procure) components from the development
Repository to the QA/Release repository. Developers can move forward,
adding dependencies freely from a third-party, proxied repository, but
once it is time to populate a release repository, a Nexus
administrator can audit the required components, create a hosted
repository, turn on procurement, populate the repository, and then
deactivate procurement. This has the effect of "locking down" the
components that are involved in a production release.

[[procure-sect-dev]]
==== Procured Development Repository

There are some development environments, which require even more
control over which components can be used and referenced by
developers. In these situations, it might make sense to only allow
developers to work with a procured repository. In this mode, a
developer must ask a Nexus administrator for permission to add a
dependency on a particular third-party artifact. A procurement manager
would then have to approve the component, or group of components so
that they would be made available to the developers. This is the
"ask-first" model for organizations that want to control which
components make it into the development cycle.

.Procurement to a Certified Development Repository
image::figs/web/procurement_ask-first-procurement.png[scale=60]

This is a model common in industries that have strict oversight
requirements. More often than not, banks, hospitals, and government
agencies have fairly strict regulations on the software that can be
used by large development teams. With the Procured Development
Repository approach, an architecture group can have full control over
what components can be referenced by a large development team.

==== Providing Access With A Repository Group

In a typical usage a software build relies on approved components that
have successfully passed procurement and as well as additional
components that have been authored internally in the organization and
are available on Nexus as well. 

In order to use a combination of such components together with the
procured component, you should set up a a repository group that
contains all repositories with pre-approved components as well as the
procurement repository. E.g. the release and snapshot repositories
could be added to the group, based on the assumption that any
internally authored components deployed there are automatically
approved. In addition you could add the 3rd party repository, if all
uploads to it are done with prior approval of the specific components.

Once this repository group is set up, you can reference it from any
tool just like the public group e.g. in a separate settings.xml used by
builds that can only have access to the approved components.

TIP: Ensure to run clean builds without any components in the local
repository of the build to ensure that only approved components are
used in the build.

[[procure-sect-configure]]
=== Setting up a Procured Repository

If you installed Nexus Professional, the Nexus Procurement Suite is
already installed and available via the Artifact Procurement option in
the Enterprise menu of the Nexus interface.

This section will walk through the process of creating and configuring
a hosted repository named "Approved From Central" which will be procured
from the "Central" proxy repository. Setting up a procured
repository consists of the following steps:

* Enabling Remote Index Downloads for a Proxy Repository

* Creating a Hosted Repository to be Procured

* Configuring Procurement for the Hosted Repository

* Configuring Procurement Rules

Before configuring a procured repository, you need to make sure that
you have enabled Remote Index downloading for the proxied repository
that will serve as the source for your procured repository.

NOTE: If you are attempting to procure components from a remote
repository which does not have a repository index, you can still use
the procurement suite. Without a remote repository index, you will
need to configure procurement rules manually without the benefit of
the already populated repository tree shown in <<procure-sect-config-rule>>.

[[procure-sect-enabled-remote]]
==== Enable Remote Index Downloads

When you configure procurement rules for a hosted repository, the
administrative interface displays the repository as a tree view using
the Maven repository format of the of groups and components using
populated from remote repository's index. Nexus ships with a set of
proxy repositories, but remote index downloading is disabled by
default.

To use procurement effectively, you will need to tell Nexus to download the remote
indexes for a proxy repository. Click on "Repositories" under
Views/Repositories in the Nexus menu, then click on the Central
Repository in the list of repositories. Click on the Configuration
tab, locate Download Remote Indexes, and switch this option to "True"
as shown in <<fig-procure-enabling-remote>>.

[[fig-procure-enabling-remote]]
.Enabling Remote Index Downloads for a Proxy Repository
image::figs/web/procure_central-download-remote-index.png[scale=60]

Click on the Save button in the dialog shown in
<<fig-procure-enabling-remote>>. Right-click on the repository row in
the Repositories list and select "Update Index". Nexus will then
download the remote repository index and recreate the index for any
Repository Groups that contain this proxied repository.

Nexus may take a few minutes to download the remote index for a large
repository. Depending on your connection to the Internet, this process
can take anywhere from under a minute to a few minutes. The size of
the remote index for the Central Repository currently exceeds 50MB and
is growing in parallel to the size of the repository itself.

To check on the status of the remote index download, click on System
Feeds under Views in the Nexus menu. Click on the last feed to see a
list of "System Changes in Nexus". If you see a log entry like the one
highlighted in <<fig-procure-system-feed>>, Nexus has successfully
downloaded the Remote Index from Maven Central.

[[procure-sect-create-hosted]]
==== Create a Hosted Repository

When you configure procurement you are establishing a relationship
between a proxy repository and a hosted repository. The hosted
repository will be the static container for the components, while the
proxy repository acts as the component source. To create a hosted
repository, select 'Repositories' from the 'Views/Repositories' section of
the Nexus menu, and click on the +Add+ button selecting 'Hosted
Repository' as shown in <<fig-procure-add-hosted>>.

[[fig-procure-add-hosted]]
.Adding a Hosted Repository
image::figs/web/procure_add-hosted.png[scale=50]

Selecting Hosted Repository will then load the Configuration form
shown in <<fig-procure-add-secured>>. Create a repository with a
Repository ID of "approved-from-central" and a name of "Approved From
Central". Make the release policy "Release". Click the Save button to
create the new Hosted Repository and view the new repository created
displayed in <<fig-procure-add-secured>>.

[[fig-procure-add-secured]]
.Adding the "Approved From Central" Hosted Repository
image::figs/web/procure_after-add-secured.png[scale=60]
          
[[procure-sect-config-procure-hosted]]
==== Configuring Procurement for Hosted Repository

At this point, the list of Repositories will have a new Hosted
repository named "Approved From Central". The next step is to start procurement for
the new repository. When you do this, you are establishing a
relationship between the new hosted repository and another repository
as source of compnents. Typically this source is a proxy repository.
In this case, we're configuring procurement for the repository
and we're telling the Procurement Suite to procure artifacts from the
'Central' proxy repository. To configure this relationship and to
start procurement, click on Artifact Procurement under the Enterprise
menu. In the Procurement panel, click on +Add Procured Repository+ as
shown in <<fig-procure-starting-procurement>>.

[[fig-procure-starting-procurement]]
.Adding a Procured Repository
image::figs/web/procure_add-procured-repository.png[scale=40]

You will then be presented with the Start Procurement dialog as shown
in <<fig-procure-start-procurement-dialog>>. Select the
"Central" proxy repository from the list of available Source
repositories.

[[fig-procure-start-procurement-dialog]] 
.Configuring Procurement for a Hosted Repository
image::figs/web/procure_configure-procurement-confirm.png[scale=60] 

Procurement is now configured and started, if you are using an
instance of Nexus installed on localhost port 8081, you can configure
your clients to reference the new repository at
http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/approved-from-central

By default, all artifacts are denied and without further customization
of the procurement rules no components will be available in the new
repository.

One interesting thing to note about the procured repository is that
the repository type changed, once procurement was started. When
procurement is activate for a hosted repository, the repository will
not show up in the repositories list as a 'User Managed
Repository'. Instead it will show up as a proxy repository in the list
of 'Nexus Managed Repositories'. Use the drop down for +User Managed/Nexus Managed
Repositories+ in the Repositories list. Click Refresh in the
Repositories list, and look at the 'Approved From Central' repository in the list of
Nexus Managed Repositories.  You will see that the repository type
column contains "proxy" as shown in <<fig-procure-hosted-now-proxy>>.
When procurement is started for a hosted repository it is effectively
a proxy repository, and when it is stopped it will revert back to
being a normal hosted repository.

[[fig-procure-hosted-now-proxy]]
.Hosted Repository is a Nexus Managed Proxy Repository while Procurement is Active
image::figs/web/procure_started-now-proxy.png[scale=50]
  

[[procure-sect-creating-rules]]
==== Procured Repository Administration

Once you've defined the relationship between a hosted repository and a
proxy repository and you have started procurement, you can start
defining the rules which will control which components are allowed in a
procured repository and which components are denied. You can also start
and stop procurement. This section details some of the administration
panels and features which are available for a procured repository.

A procurement rule is a rule to allow or deny the procurement of a
group, artifact, or a collection of groups or artifacts. You load the
Artifact Procurement interface by selecting Artifact Procurement under
the Enterprise section of the Nexus menu.  Clicking on this link will
load a list of procured repositories.  Clicking on the repository will
load the entire repository in a tree as shown in
<<fig-procure-repository-view>>.

This section will illustrate the steps required for blocking access to
an entire artifact and then selectively allowing access to a
particular version of that same artifact. This is a common use-case in
organizations which want to standardize on specific versions of a
particular dependency.

NOTE: If you are attempting to procure artifacts from a remote
repository which does not have a repository index, you can still use
the procurement suite. Without a remote repository index, you will
need to configure procurement rules manually without the benefit of
the already populated repository tree shown in this section.

[[fig-procure-repository-view]]
.Viewing a Repository in the Artifact Procurement Interface
image::figs/web/procure_repository-view.png[scale=60]

The directory tree in <<fig-procure-repository-view>> is the index of
the proxy repository from which artifacts are being procured.

[[procure-sect-config-rule]]
=== Configuring a Procurement Rule

To configure a procurement rule, right click on a folder in the
tree. <<fig-procure-deny-group-all>> displays the
procurement interface after right clicking on the jython artifact
folder. In this dialog, we are telling the procurement interface to
deny everything in the jython group and its sub-groups. If you attempt
to retrieve any version under the jython artifact after this rule is
created, the Procurement Suite will prevent access to this
artifact. For example, if you attempt to build a project that depends
on jython:jython:2.1, it will not be made available via the Secured
repository created in <<procure-sect-configure>>.

[[fig-procure-deny-group-all]]
.Denying Procurement for Everything Under a Group
image::figs/web/procure_deny-all-jython.png[scale=60]

After denying access to the entire jython artifact, right-click on the
2.1 version folder under the jython artifact folder. Select "Exactly
the artifact" as shown in <<fig-procure-allowing-artifact>> to allow
for the procurement of only the 2.1 version. This has the effect of
creating a specific rule which allows the procurement of a single
version of the jython:jython artifact.

[[fig-procure-allowing-artifact]]
.Allowing Access to a Single Artifact in a Denied Group
image::figs/web/procure_approve-artifact.png[scale=60]

After allowing this element, your procurement tree is going to contain
red and green markers on the affected folders as shown in
<<fig-procure-composite-effects>>. While the jython artifact folder
has a red slash through it the 2.1 version folder has a green
check. You have configured the Procurement Suite to deny access to all
versions of the jython artifact except version 2.1.

[[fig-procure-composite-effects]]
.Viewing the Effect of Composite Procurement Rules on the Tree
image::figs/web/procure_only-one-jython.png[scale=60]

[[procure-sect-manage-rules]]
=== Managing Procurement Rules

Once you've created a set of procurement rules you are going to want
to know how to view the procurement rules which are applicable to a
particular node. Procurement rules will frequently overlap; for
example, in <<procure-sect-creating-rules>>, there are
two rules: one rule applies to all of the versions (folder) below the
jython artifact folder, and the other rule applies to a particular
version directory. Since rules can overlap, Nexus provides a simple
way to list and manage the rules which apply to a specific node in the
directory tree. <<fig-procure-composite-effects>> shows
the resolved procurement rules after clicking on the Jython 2.1
version artifact from <<procure-sect-configure>>.

[[fig-procure-effective]]
.Effective Procurement Rules for a Particular Node
image::figs/web/procure_effective-rules.png[scale=60]

This dialog gives the procurement administrator a fine-grained view
into the rules that apply to a particular node. From this dialog you
can remove rules which apply to a specific node.

[[procure-sect-stopping]]
=== Stopping Procurement

Some organizations may want to "lock down" the artifacts that a
release build can depend upon, and it is also a good idea to make sure
that your build isn't going to be affected by changes to a repository
not under you control. A procurement administrator might configure a
procured repository, start procurement, and run an enterprise build
against the repository to populate the procured, hosted repository
with all of the necessary artifacts. After this process, the
procurement administrator can stop procurement and continue to run the
same release build against the hosted repository which now contains
all of the procured artifacts.

To stop procurement, go to the Artifact Procurement management
interface by clicking on Artifact Procurement under the Enterprise
section of the Nexus menu. Right click on the repository and choose
Stop Procurement as shown in <<fig-procure-stopping>>.

[[fig-procure-stopping]]
.Stopping Procurement for a Procured Repository
image::figs/web/procure_stop-procurement.png[scale=60]

After choosing Stop Procurement, you will then see a dialog confirming
your decision to stop procurement. Once procurement is stopped, the
Secure repository will revert back to being a plain-old Hosted
Repository.
