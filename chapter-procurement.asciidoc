== Procurement Suite

{inrmonly}

[[procure-sect-intro]]
=== Introduction

The Procurement Suite of {pro} provides an organization with control over what components are allowed into a
repository from an external, proxied repository such as the Central Repository. Such control can be a prerequisite
for organizations unwilling or unable to trust the entire contents of an external public repository. If an
organization is developing mission critical code, they will likely want to subject every third party dependency to
intense scrutiny and testing before making the component available to build a release or support a team of
developers. In most Enterprise development environments, a developer can't just decide to add in a new dependency
to Hibernate or to the Spring Framework on a whim; the decision to add dependencies to third-party libraries will
need to be funnelled through an oversight process that relies on an architect or an administrator to promote
components to a certified release repository.

Another more common experience is an organization that needs to
proxy like the Central Repository or any other public repository, but wants to limit
access to specific versions of components or prevent dependencies on
all components contained under a specific group. Some organizations are
more amenable to trusting the contents of a remote, proxied repository
like the Central Repository, but they also need the ability to block certain
dependencies.  Maybe you work on a team that needs to limit access to
dependencies with a certain license, or maybe you just want to make
sure no one uses a problematic version of Hibernate with a known bug?
The procurement suite is the tool that provides for both coarse and
fine-grained control of the components that can appear in a repository.

[[procure-sect-stages]] 
=== The Stages of Procurement

A procured repository is a hosted Repository that procures components
from a Proxy Repository while procurement is enabled. For example,
one could create a hosted repository named "Approved From Central" and then
configure this hosted repository to procure components from the
"Central" repository. Once the hosted repository has been created and
the source of procurement has been configured, the repository will
obtain components from the proxy repository as long as procurement is
activated.  If you start procurement for a hosted repository, the
hosted repository will fetch components from the proxy repository
specified in the procurement settings. If you stop procurement for a
hosted repository, no additional components will be retrieved from the
proxy repository specified in the procurement settings. Without
procurement active it is a hosted repository and therefore completely static.

The ability to enable or disable procurement for a hosted repository
comes in very handy when you want to "certify" a hosted repository as
containing all of the components (no more and no less) required for a
production build. You can start procurement, run a build that
triggers component procurement, and then stop procurement, knowing that
the procured repository now contains all of the components required
for building a specific project. Stopping procurement assures you that
the contents of the repository will not change if the third-party,
external proxied repository does. This is an extra level of assurance
that your release components depend on a set of components under your
complete control.

[[procure-sect-approaches]]
=== Two Approaches to Procurement

There are two main use cases for the Procurement Suite. In the first
use case, the 'Procured Release Repository', the procurement features
are used to create a procured release repository to make sure that the
organization has full control over the components that are making it
into a production release. The other use case, the 'Procured
Development Repository', is for organizations that need more up-front
control over which components are allowed during the development of a
project. The following sections describe these two uses cases in more
detail.

[[procure-sect-cert]] 
==== Procured Release Repository

The Procurement Suite can be used in two different ways.  In the "Procured Release" mode, developers work with a
proxied third-party repository exactly as they would without the Procurement Suite.  When a developer needs to add
a dependency on a new component, the repository manager will retrieve the component from the third-party
repository (like Central or Apache Snapshots) and this component will be served to Maven via a proxied
repository. When a QA or Release engineer needs to build a release or staging component, the Release or QA build
would be configured to execute against a procured repository or repository group with only approved and procured
repositories. A procured repository is one that only serves the components that have been explicitly approved
using the Procurement Suite.

.Procurement to a Certified Release Repository
image::figs/web/procurement_release-procurement.png[scale=60]

In this model, developers can add as many third-party dependencies as they want, and it is the responsibility of
the QA and release engineers to approve (or procure) components from the development Repository to the QA/Release
repository. Developers can move forward, adding dependencies freely from a third-party, proxied repository, but
once it is time to populate a release repository, an administrator can audit the required components, create a
hosted repository, turn on procurement, populate the repository, and then deactivate procurement. This has the
effect of "locking down" the components that are involved in a production release.

[[procure-sect-dev]]
==== Procured Development Repository

There are some development environments that require even more control over which components can be used and
referenced by developers. In these situations, it might make sense to only allow developers to work with a
procured repository. In this mode, a developer must ask an administrator for permission to add a dependency on a
particular third-party component. A procurement manager would then have to approve the component or group of
components so that they would be made available to the developers. This is the "ask-first" model for organizations
that want to control which components make it into the development cycle.

.Procurement to a Certified Development Repository
image::figs/web/procurement_ask-first-procurement.png[scale=60]

This is a model common in industries that have strict oversight
requirements. More often than not, banks, hospitals, and government
agencies have fairly strict regulations on the software that can be
used by large development teams. With the Procured Development
Repository approach, an architecture group can have full control over
what components can be referenced by a large development team.

==== Providing Access with a Repository Group

In a typical usage a software build relies on approved components that have successfully passed procurement and
additional components that have been authored internally in the organization and are available on the repository
manager as well.

In order to use a combination of such components together with the
procured component, you should set up a repository group that
contains all repositories with preapproved components as well as the
procurement repository. For example, the release and snapshot repositories
could be added to the group, based on the assumption that any
internally authored components deployed there are automatically
approved. In addition, you could add the third-party repository, if all
uploads to it are done with prior approval of the specific components.

Once this repository group is set up, you can reference it from any
tool just like the public group, e.g., in a separate settings.xml used by
builds that can only have access to the approved components.

TIP: When running builds you need to make sure that you run to run clean builds.
No components from other builds, accessing non-procured repositories, should be 
in the local repository of the build. This ensures that only approved components are
used in the build. The easiest way to achieve this is to clear the local repository 
before a build or to run the build against a project specific local repository.

[[procure-sect-configure]]
=== Setting up a Procured Repository

If you installed {pro}, the {pro}curement Suite is already installed and available via the 'Artifact Procurement'
option in the 'Enterprise' menu of the user interface.

This section will walk through the process of creating and configuring
a hosted repository named 'Approved From Central' which will be procured
from the 'Central' proxy repository. Setting up a procured
repository consists of the following steps:

* Enable the remote index downloads for the proxy repository, that 
will act as the source of the procured components.

* Create a hosted repository, which will be the target of the procurement.

* Configure procurement for the hosted repository.

* Configure the procurement rules.

Before configuring a procured repository, you need to make sure that
you have enabled Remote Index downloading for the proxied repository
that will serve as the source for your procured repository.

NOTE: If you are attempting to procure components from a remote
repository that does not have a repository index, you can still use
the procurement suite. Without a remote repository index, you will
need to configure procurement rules manually without the benefit of
the already populated repository tree shown in <<procure-sect-config-rule>>.

[[procure-sect-enabled-remote]]
==== Enable Remote Index Downloads

When you configure procurement rules for a hosted repository, the administrative interface displays the repository
as a tree view using the Maven repository format of the of groups and components using populated from remote
repository's index. {pro} ships with a set of proxy repositories, but remote index downloading is disabled by
default.

To use procurement effectively, you will need to tell {pro} to download the remote indexes for a proxy
repository. Click on 'Repositories' under 'Views/Repositories' in the main menu, then click on the 'Central
Repository' in the list of repositories. Click on the 'Configuration' tab, locate 'Download Remote Indexes', and
switch this option to 'True' as shown in <<fig-procure-enabling-remote>>.

[[fig-procure-enabling-remote]]
.Enabling Remote Index Downloads for a Proxy Repository
image::figs/web/procure_central-download-remote-index.png[scale=60]

Click on the 'Save' button in the dialog shown in <<fig-procure-enabling-remote>>. Right-click on the repository
row in the Repositories list and select 'Update Index'. The repository manager will then download the remote
repository index and recreate the index for any repository groups that contain this proxied repository.

The repository manager may take a few minutes to download the remote index for a large repository. Depending on
your connection to the Internet, this process can take anywhere from under a minute to a few minutes. The size of
the remote index for the Central Repository currently exceeds 50MB and is growing in parallel to the size of the
repository itself.

To check on the status of the remote index download, click on 'System Feeds' under 'Views/Repositories' in the
main menu. Click on the last feed to see a list of 'System Changes in Nexus'. If you see a log entry like the one
highlighted in <<fig-procure-system-feed>>, the repository manager has successfully completd the download of the
remote index from the Central Repository.

[[procure-sect-create-hosted]]
==== Create a Hosted Repository

When you configure procurement you are establishing a relationship between a proxy repository and a hosted
repository. The hosted repository will be the static container for the components, while the proxy repository acts
as the component source. To create a hosted repository, select 'Repositories' from the 'Views/Repositories'
section of the main menu, and click on the 'Add' button selecting 'Hosted Repository' as shown in
<<fig-procure-add-hosted>>.

[[fig-procure-add-hosted]]
.Adding the "Approved From Central" Hosted Repository
image::figs/web/procure_add-hosted.png[scale=50]

Selecting 'Hosted Repository' will then load the configuration
form. Create a repository with a 'Repository ID' of
+approved-from-central+ and a name of +Approved From Central+. Make
the release policy +Release+. Click the 'Save' button to create the new
hosted repository.

[[procure-sect-config-procure-hosted]]
==== Configuring Procurement for Hosted Repository

At this point, the list of Repositories will have a new Hosted
repository named +Approved From Central=. The next step is to start procurement for
the new repository. When you do this, you are establishing a
relationship between the new hosted repository and another repository
as source of components. Typically, this source is a proxy repository.
In this case, we're configuring procurement for the repository
and we're telling the Procurement Suite to procure components from the
'Central' proxy repository. To configure this relationship and to
start procurement, click on 'Artifact Procurement' under the 'Enterprise'
menu. In the 'Procurement' panel, click on 'Add Procured Repository' as
shown in <<fig-procure-starting-procurement>>.

[[fig-procure-starting-procurement]]
.Adding a Procured Repository
image::figs/web/procure_add-procured-repository.png[scale=50]

You will then be presented with the Start Procurement dialog as shown
in <<fig-procure-start-procurement-dialog>>. Select the
"Central" proxy repository from the list of available Source
repositories.

[[fig-procure-start-procurement-dialog]] 
.Configuring Procurement for a Hosted Repository
image::figs/web/procure_configure-procurement-confirm.png[scale=50] 

Procurement is now configured and started. If you are using an instance of {pro} installed on localhost port 8081,
you can configure your clients to reference the new repository at
+http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/approved-from-central+.

By default, all components are denied and without further customization
of the procurement rules no components will be available in the new
repository.

One interesting thing to note about the procured repository is that the repository type changed once procurement
was started. When procurement is activated for a hosted repository, the repository will not show up in the
repositories list as a 'User Managed Repository'. Instead it will show up as a proxy repository in the list of
'Nexus Managed Repositories'. Use the drop-down for 'User Managed/Nexus Managed Repositories' in the Repositories
list. Click Refresh in the Repositories list, and look at the 'Approved From Central' repository in the list of
Nexus Managed Repositories.  You will see that the repository type column contains +proxy+ as shown in
<<fig-procure-hosted-now-proxy>>.  When procurement is started for a hosted repository, it is effectively a proxy
repository, and when it is stopped it will revert back to being a normal hosted repository.

[[fig-procure-hosted-now-proxy]]
.Hosted Repository is a Nexus Managed Proxy Repository while Procurement is Active
image::figs/web/procure_started-now-proxy.png[scale=50]
  

[[procure-sect-creating-rules]]
==== Procured Repository Administration

Once you've defined the relationship between a hosted repository and a
proxy repository and you have started procurement, you can start
defining the rules that will control which components are allowed in a
procured repository and which components are denied. You can also start
and stop procurement. This section details some of the administration
panels and features that are available for a procured repository.

A procurement rule is a rule to allow or deny the procurement of a group, component, or a collection of groups or
components. You load the Artifact Procurement interface by selecting Artifact Procurement in the Enterprise menu
of the left-hand navigation. Clicking on this link will load a list of procured repositories.  Clicking on the
repository will display the proxied source repository and the current content of the procured repository in a tree
as shown in <<fig-procure-repository-view>>.

This section will illustrate the steps required for blocking access to
a specific component and then selectively allowing access to a
particular version of that same component. This is a common use case in
organizations that want to standardize specific versions of a
particular dependency.

NOTE: If you are attempting to procure components from a remote
repository that does not have a repository index, you can still use
the procurement suite. Without a remote repository index, you will
need to configure procurement rules manually without the benefit of
the already populated repository tree shown in this section.

[[fig-procure-repository-view]]
.Viewing a Repository in the Artifact Procurement Interface
image::figs/web/procure_repository-view.png[scale=60]

The directory tree in <<fig-procure-repository-view>> is the index of
the proxy repository from which components are being procured.

[[procure-sect-config-rule]]
=== Configuring Procurement

To configure a procurement rule, right-click on a folder in the
tree. <<fig-procure-aether>> displays the procurement interface after
right-clicking on the +org/eclipse/aether+ component folder.

[[fig-procure-aether]]
.Applying a Rule to a Component Folder for +org/elipse/aether+
image::figs/web/procure-aether.png[scale=60]

In this dialog, we are deciding to configure a rule for everything
within the group and its sub groups that display the rule
configuration dialog displayed in <<fig-procure-aether-add-rule>>.
The dialog to add rules allows you to select the available rule,
e.g., a Forced Approve/Deny Rule, and configure the rule
properties. The displayed dialog approves all components Eclipse
Aether components.

[[fig-procure-aether-add-rule]]
.Approving +org.eclipse.aether+ Components 
image::figs/web/procure-aether-add-rule.png[scale=60]

By right-clicking on the top level folder of the repository, as
displayed in <<fig-procure-global-rules>>, you can configure rules for
the complete repository as well as access all configured rules via the
'Applied Rules' option.

[[fig-procure-global-rules]]
.Accessing the Global Repository Configuration
image::figs/web/procure-global-rules.png[scale=60]

This allows you to set up a global rule, like blocking all components
from the repository. Once you have configured this you can then
selectively allow specific versions of a
component. <<fig-procure-collections-version>> displays the options
available for configuring rules for a specific component version of
the Apache Commons Collections component.

[[fig-procure-collections-version]]
.Procurement Configurations Options for a Specific Component Version
image::figs/web/procure-collections-version.png[scale=60]

Once you approve a specific version, the tree view will change the
icons for the component displaying green checkmarks for approved
components and red cross lines for denied components as visible in
<<fig-procure-status-tree>>. The icons are updated for signature
validation rule violations, if applicable, showing a yellow icon.

[[fig-procure-status-tree]]
.Procurement Repository Tree View with Rule Visualization
image::figs/web/procure-status-tree.png[scale=60]

An example dialog of Applied Rules for the complete repository, as
configured by '*:*:*', is visible in <<fig-procure-applied-rules>>.
This repository currently denies access to all components, only
approving components within 'org/apache/maven' and
'org/eclipse/aether''.

This dialog gives the procurement administrator a fine-grained view
into the rules that apply to the complete repository. A view of all
Applied Rules for a specific repository folder can be access by
right-clicking on the folder and selecting Applied Rules. The dialog
allows you to remove specific rules or all rules as well.
  
[[fig-procure-applied-rules]]
.Applied Rules for the Complete Procurement Repository
image::figs/web/procure-applied-rules.png[scale=60]

The 'Refresh' button above the tree view of a repository tree view
allows you to update the tree view and to see all of the
applied rules. The 'Add Freeform Rule' button allows you to display
the dialog to manually configure a procurement rule displayed in
<<fig-procure-freeform-rule>>. This is especially useful if the tree
view is not complete due to a missing repository index or if you have
detailed knowledge of the component to which you want to apply a rule. 
The format for entering a specific component in the 'Enter
GAV' input field is the short form for a Maven component coordinate
using the groupId, artifactId and version separated by ':'. The '*'
character can be used as a wildcard for a complete coordinate.

[[fig-procure-freeform-rule]]
.Adding a Freeform Rule
image::figs/web/procure-freeform-rule.png[scale=60]

Examples for freeform rule coordinates are: 


`*:*:*`::  matches any component in the complete repository

`org.apache.ant:*:*`:: matches any component with the groupId
+org.apache.ant+ located in +org/apache/ant+

`org.apache.ant.*:*:*`:: matches any component with the groupId +org.apache.ant+
 located in +org/apache/ant+ as well as any sub-groups
e.g., +org.apache.ant.ant+

These coordinates are displayed in the Maven build output log when
retrieving a component fails. You can see them as part of the error message 
with the addition of the packaging type. It is therefore possible to cut and
paste the respective coordinates from the build output and insert
them into a freeform rule. Once you have done that you can kick off
the build again, potentially forcing downloads with the option +-U+
and continue procurement configuration for further components.


[[procure-sect-stopping]]
=== Stopping Procurement

Some organizations may want to lock down the components that a
release build can depend upon. It is also a good idea to make sure
that your build isn't going to be affected by changes to a repository
not under you control. A procurement administrator can configure a
procured repository, start procurement, and run an enterprise build
against the repository to populate the procured, hosted repository
with all of the necessary components. After this process, the
procurement administrator can stop procurement and continue to run the
same release build against the hosted repository that now contains
all of the procured components while being a completely static
repository.

To stop procurement, go to the procurement management
interface by clicking on 'Artifact Procurement' under the 'Enterprise'
section of the menu. Right-click on the repository and choose
'Stop Procurement' as shown in <<fig-procure-stopping>>.

[[fig-procure-stopping]]
.Stopping Procurement for a Procured Repository
image::figs/web/procure_stop-procurement.png[scale=60]

After choosing 'Stop Procurement', you will then see a dialog confirming
your decision to stop procurement. Once procurement is stopped, the
procured  repository will revert back to being a hosted
repository.

In order to add further components, you create a procurement repository
off the hosted repository as you did initially. If the repository
contains components already, activating procurement will automatically
generate rules that allow all components already within the
repository.
