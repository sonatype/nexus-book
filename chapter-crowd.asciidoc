== Atlassian Crowd Support

http://www.atlassian.com/software/crowd/[Atlassian Crowd] is a single
sign-on and identity management product that many organizations use to
consolidate user accounts and control which users and groups have access
to which applications. Nexus Pro contains a security realm that
allows you to configure Nexus to authenticate against an Atlassian Crowd
instance.

The following steps are necessary to configure Nexus with Crowd-based
authentication:

. <<crowd-sect-nexus-prepare,Prepare Nexus>>
. <<crowd-sect-crowd-prepare,Prepare Atlassian Crowd>>
. <<crowd-sect-config,Configure the Nexus Crowd Connection>>
. <<crowd-sect-mapping,Configure Nexus Crowd Security>>
. <<crowd-sect-realm,Activate the Nexus Crowd Realm>>

NOTE: Atlassian Crowd support is a Nexus Pro feature.

[[crowd-sect-nexus-prepare]]
=== Prepare Nexus for Atlassian Crowd

Atlassian Crowd support is preinstalled and ready to configure in
Nexus Pro 2.7+.

In older Nexus versions, Nexus Crowd support is implemented as an
optional plugin that comes as part of any Nexus Pro download.
The directory containing the plugin code is called either
enterprise-crowd-plugin-X.Y.Z or nexus-crowd-plugin-X.Y.Z. Install the
plugin following the instructions in <<install-additional-plugins>>.

WARNING: *Using LDAP and Crowd Realms together in Nexus may work, but
this is not supported.* If you already use Nexus LDAP support, we recommend
adding your LDAP server as a Crowd directory accessible to the Crowd
'nexus' application instead of using both LDAP and Crowd realms in
Nexus.

[[crowd-sect-crowd-prepare]]
=== Prepare Atlassian Crowd

[[crowd-sect-crowd-compat]]
==== Compatibility

Always use the latest version of Crowd available at the time your
version of Nexus was released. When upgrading to a newer Crowd server,
carefully review the Crowd server release notes for REST API backwards
compatibility issues.

Crowd support in Nexus 2.7 and greater will only work in Crowd
versions (2.1+) that support the Crowd REST API. Older versions use a
deprecated SOAP-based API and are less reliable and performant.

Crowd support is actively tested with the highest available version of
Crowd at the time Nexus is released.

==== Configure a Nexus Application in the Atlassian Crowd Server

NOTE: These instructions are a general guide to adding an
application to Crowd. For current detailed instructions, visit the
https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/CROWD/Adding+an+Application[official
Crowd documentation].

To connect Nexus to Atlassian's Crowd, you will need to configure Nexus
as an application in Crowd. 

. Login to Crowd as a user with administrative rights.
. Click on the 'Applications' tab.
. Click 'Add Application' to display the form shown in
<<fig-crowd-app>>, and create a new application with the following
values in the 'Details' tab of the Add Application form:

* Application Type: Generic Application

* Name: nexus

* Description: Nexus Repository Manager

. Choose a password for this application. Nexus will use this password
to authenticate with the Crowd server. Click on the Next button.

[[fig-crowd-app]]
.Creating a Nexus Crowd Application
image::figs/web/crowd_new-app.png[scale=60]

Clicking on 'Next' will advance the form to the 'Connection' tab shown
in <<fig-crowd-app-connection>>. In this tab you need to supply the
URL of your Nexus application instance and the remote IP address for
Nexus. <<fig-crowd-app-connection>>, shows the Connection form
configured for a local instance of Nexus. If you were configuring
Crowd and Nexus in a production environment, you would supply the URL
that users would use to load Nexus in a web browser and you would
supply the IP address that Nexus will be connecting from.  Once you
have completed the 'Connection' form, click on 'Next' to advance to
the 'Directories' form shown in <<fig-crowd-app-directories>>.

[[fig-crowd-app-connection]]
.Creating a Nexus Crowd Application Connection
image::figs/web/crowd_new-app-connection.png[scale=60]

The 'Directories' form allows you to select the user directory used
for Nexus authentication. In this example, the default 'User
Management' directory will be used.

[[fig-crowd-app-directories]]
.Choosing Atlassian Crowd Application Directories
image::figs/web/crowd_new-app-directories.png[scale=60]

Clicking on the 'Next' button in the 'Directories' form advances to
the 'Authorisation' form shown in <<fig-crowd-app-authorization>>. If
any of the directories selected in the previous form contain groups,
each group is displayed on this form next to a checkbox. You can
select 'Allow all users' for a directory or you can select specific
groups that are allowed to authenticate to Nexus via Crowd. This
option would be used if you wanted to limit Nexus access to specific
subgroups within a larger Crowd directory. If your entire organization
is stored in a single Crowd directory, you may want to limit Nexus
access to a group that contains only developers and administrators.

[[crowd-sect-config]]
=== Configure Nexus Crowd Integration


[[crowd-sect-ssl]]
==== Configure Nexus to Trust Crowdâ€™s Secure URL (Optional)

Although optional, we advise the connection from Nexus to your Crowd
server to use the HTTPS protocol.

If the Crowd Server certificate is not signed by a public certificate
authority, you may have to explicitly trust the server certificate
using <<ssl,Nexus SSL support>>. A common symptom observed are +peer
not authenticated+ messages, when trying to connect to the Crowd
server.

Steps to explicitly trust the Crowd Server URL certificate in Nexus
are:

. <<crowd-sect-ssl-capability,Enable the SSL: Crowd capability>>
. <<crowd-sect-ssl-trust,Add the Crowd server certificate to Nexus truststore>>
. <<crowd-sect-config-connection,Configure Crowd Connection URL using
the HTTPS url>>

NOTE: The 'SSL: Crowd' capability is only available in Nexus 2.7+. Older
versions must manually configure trust using an explicit truststore
specified with JRE system properties.

[[crowd-sect-ssl-capability]]
===== Enabling the SSL: Crowd Capability

. Login to Nexus as an Administrator.
. In the sidebar menu, click 'Administration' -> 'Capabilities' to
open the 'Capabilities' panel.
. Click the 'Add' button in the panel toolbar. Select 'SSL: Crowd' in
the 'Type' field. Make sure the 'Enabled' checkbox is checked, and
click the 'Save' button.

[[fig-crowd-capability-ssl]]

[[crowd-sect-ssl-trust]]
===== Adding the Crowd Server Certificate to the Nexus Truststore

In order to add the server certificate of your Crowd server to the
Nexus truststore, locate the HTTPS 'Crowd Server URL' and follow the
'Load from server' instructions in <<ssl-sect-client-cert-mgt>>.


[[crowd-sect-config-connection]]
==== Configure Nexus Crowd Connection

The Crowd Configuration screen displayed in <<fig-crowd-config>> can be
accessed by users with administrative privileges in Nexus by selecting
'Crowd' in the 'Security' section of the Nexus menu.

[[fig-crowd-config]]
.Crowd Configuration Panel
image::figs/web/crowd_server-config.png[scale=60]

This panel contains the following fields:

Application Name:: This field contains the application name of a Crowd
application. This value should match the value in the Name field of
the form shown in <<fig-crowd-app>>.

Application Password:: This field contains the application password of
a Crowd application. This value should match the value in the Password
field of the form shown in <<fig-crowd-app>>.

[[crowd-sect-config-crowd-server-url]]
Crowd Server URL:: This is the URL used to connect to the Crowd
Server.  Both 'http://' and 'https://' URLs are accepted. You may need
to <<crowd-sect-ssl,trust the crowd server certificate>> if a
'https://' URL is used.

HTTP Timeout:: The HTTP Timeout specifies the number of milliseconds
Nexus will wait for a response from Crowd. A value of zero indicates
that there is no timeout limit. Leave the field blank to use the Nexus
server default HTTP timeout.

You can use the 'Test Connection' button to validate if your connection
to Crowd is working. Once you have a working connection, do not forget
to 'Save' your configuration. Use 'Cancel' to abort saving any changes.

[[crowd-sect-mapping]]
=== Configure Nexus Crowd Security

There are two approaches available to manage what privileges a Crowd
user has when they login to Nexus.

. <<crowd-sect-mapping-group,Mapping Crowd Groups to Nexus Roles>>
. <<crowd-sect-mapping-user,Mapping Crowd Users to Nexus Roles>>

NOTE: Mapping Crowd Groups to Nexus Roles is preferable because there is 
less configuration is involved overall in Nexus  and  assigning users 
to Crowd groups can be centrally managed inside of Crowd by your 
security team after the initial Nexus setup

[[crowd-sect-mapping-group]]
==== Mapping a Crowd Group to Nexus Role

When mapping a Crowd group to a Nexus role, you are specifying the
permissions ( via roles ) that users within the Crowd group will have
after they authenticate to Nexus.

To map a Crowd group to a Nexus role, open the 'Roles' panel by
clicking on the 'Roles' link under the 'Security' section of the Nexus
sidebar menu. Click on the 'Add...' button and select 'External Role
Mapping' as shown in <<fig-crowd-add-ext-role-map>> and the
<<fig-crowd-map-ext-role,Map External Role>> dialog.

[[fig-crowd-add-ext-role-map]]
.Adding an External Role Mapping

[[fig-crowd-map-ext-role]]
.Mapping an External Crowd Group to a Nexus Role
image::figs/web/crowd_map-ext-role.png[scale=60]

After choosing the 'Crowd' realm, the 'Role' drop-down should list all
the Crowd groups the 'nexus' crowd application has access to. Select
the group to would like to map in the 'Role' field and click 'Create
Mapping'.

NOTE: If you have two or more groups in Crowd accessible to the 'nexus'
application with the same name but in different directories, Nexus will
only list the first one that Crowd finds. Therefore, Crowd administrators
should avoid identically named groups in Crowd directories.

Before saving the group-to-role mapping, *you 'must' add at
least one Nexus role to the mapped group*. After you have added the
Nexus roles using the 'Add' button, click the 'Save' button.

[[fig-crowd-add-map-ext-role-unsaved]]
.Unsaved Mapping of External Crowd 'dev' Group to Nexus Developers Role
image::figs/web/crowd_ext-role-mapping-unsaved.png[scale=60]

Saved mappings will appear in the list of Nexus Roles with a mapping
value of 'Crowd', as shown in <<fig-crowd-add-map-ext-role>>.

[[fig-crowd-add-map-ext-role]]
.Mapped External Crowd 'dev' Group to Nexus Developers Role
image::figs/web/crowd_ext-role-mapped.png[scale=60]

[[crowd-sect-mapping-user]]
==== Mapping a Crowd User to Nexus Role

To illustrate this feature, consider the Crowd server user with an id
of +brian+. As visible in the Crowd administrative interface in
<<fig-crowd-view-user-groups-brian>>, the user is a member of the
+dev+ group.

[[fig-crowd-view-user-groups-brian]]
.Crowd Groups for User "brian"
image::figs/web/crowd_view-user-groups-brian.png[scale=60]

To add an 'External User Role Mapping', open the 'Users' panel in
Nexus by clicking 'Users' in the 'Security' section of the Nexus
sidebar menu.

Click on the 'Add...' button and select 'External User Role Mapping'
from the drop-down as shown in <<fig-crowd-add-ext-user-role-map>>.

[[fig-crowd-add-ext-user-role-map]]
.Adding an External User Role Mapping
image::figs/web/crowd_add-ext-user-role-mapping.png[scale=60]

Selecting 'External User Role Mapping' will show a mapping panel where
you can <<fig-crowd-find-external-user,locate a user by Crowd user
id>>.

[[fig-crowd-find-external-user]]
.Locate a Crowd User by User ID
image::figs/web/crowd_find-external-user.png[scale=60]

Typing the Crowd user id - for example +brian+ - in the 'Enter a User
ID' field and clicking the magnifying glass icon, will cause Nexus to
search for a user ID +brian+ in all known realms, including Crowd.

Once you locate the Crowd user, use 'Add' button to add Nexus roles to
the Crowd User. *You must map at least one Nexus role to the Crowd
managed user* in order to 'Save'.  <<fig-crowd-assign-user-role>>
displays the 'brian' Crowd realm user as a member of the 'dev' Crowd
group and the mapped Nexus role called 'Nexus Administator
Role'. External groups like +dev+ are bolded in the 'Role Managment'
list.

[[crowd-sect-realm]]
=== Activate Nexus Crowd Realm

The final step to allow Crowd users to authenticate against Nexus is to
activate the Crowd authorization realm in the 'Security Settings'
displayed in <<fig-crowd-activate-realm>>.

[[fig-crowd-activate-realm]]
.Activating the Crowd Realm
image::figs/web/crowd_activate-realm.png[scale=60]

. Select 'Administration' -> 'Server' from the Nexus sidebar menu.
. Scroll down to the 'Security Settings' section.
. Drag 'Crowd Realm' from the list of 'Available Realms' to the end
of the 'Selected Realms' list.
. 'Save' the server settings.
