== Installing and Running Nexus

[[install-introduction]]
=== Introduction

Nexus is a Java application that requires a Java Runtime Environment. When you run Nexus, you are running a server
application with a web-based user interface.  The Nexus application runs with the Eclipse Jetty servlet container
and Apache Karaf OSGi-container. 

Installation is a simple process. This chapter provides further details to get started with Nexus and keep it
running successfully in production deployments.

WARNING: Currently Nexus 3 is a pre-release application and running it for production usage is not recommended.

[[install-sect-downloading]]
=== Downloading Nexus

Nexus can be downloaded from https://support.sonatype.com/forums/23079216[Sonatype]. Bundles are available for the
64-bit versions for Apple OSX, Microsoft Windows and Unix/Linux. They contain all necessary resources to install and run
Nexus. You can download a plain archive file or an installer for your operating system of a specific release
version of Nexus.

The plain archive files are Gzip TAR (TGZ) or ZIP files and are suitable for installation without a graphical user
interface purely using command line-based interaction. The file names include operating system qualifiers and are
similar to similar to:

[subs="attributes"]
----
nexus-{version-exact}-mac.tgz 
nexus-{version-exact}-unix.tar.gz
nexus-{version-exact}-win64.zip
----

The operating system-specific installer applications can be used for installation in a graphical user interface.  The file
naming includes operating system qualifiers and uses the native extensions for applications:

[subs="attributes"]
----
nexus-{version-exact}-mac.dmg
nexus-{version-exact}-unix.sh
nexus-{version-exact}-win64.exe
----

Next steps, after a successful download, depend on the bundle you downloaded and the operating system and are
documented in <<installation-archive>> and <<installation-installer>>.


=== Java Runtime Environment

{nexus} requires a Java 8 Runtime Environment (JRE) from Oracle. The install bundles for OSX and Windows include suitable
runtime environments for the specific operating system.

If you prefer to use an external runtime or use a Unix operating system, we recommend to use the latest version of
Java 8 available from the http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Oracle website].

You can confirm the installed Java version with the `java` command:

----
$  java -version
java version "1.8.0_60"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_60-b27)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.60-b23, mixed mode)
----

When multiple JDK or JRE versions are installed, you need to ensure the correct version is configured by running
the above command as the operating system user, that is used to run Nexus. Potentially you need to update the
configuration to specify a specific JRE installation path.

TIP: OpenJDK or other Java distributions or older Java versions are not supported.

[[installation-archive]]
===  Installing and Running with the Bundle Archive

The bundle archives combine the Nexus application and all required resources in an archive
file. Installing and running Nexus is straightforward. Simply unpack the Nexus bundle archive in a directory, to
which you have full access. 

If you are installing Nexus on a local workstation to give it a test run, you can install it in your home
directory or wherever you like. Nexus doesn't have any hard-coded directories and will run from any directory.

You can extract the archive ZIP for Windows with any archiving tool like http://www.7-zip.org/download.html[7zip]
or on the command line with e.g.  

[subs="attributes"]
----
$ 7za.exe e nexus-{version-exact}-win64.zip
----

On Windows you should install Nexus outside +Program Files+ to avoid problems with Windows file registry
virtualization. If you plan to run the repository manager as a specific user you can install it into the
+AppData\Local+ directory of that users home directory. Otherwise simply use e.g., +C:\nexus+ or something
similar, ensuring that the user running the application has full access.

On OSX or Linux the downloaded GZip’d TAR archive can be extracted with:

[subs="attributes"]
----
$ tar xvzf nexus-{version-exact}-mac.tgz
$ tar xvzf nexus-{version-exact}-unix.tar.gz
----

You install the repository manager in a directory other than your users home directory. On a
Unix machine common practice is to use `/opt`.

The extraction process creates a directory with a number of directories inside. Further
details about these folders can be found in <<directories>>

The `bin` folder contains the generic startup scripts for Unix-like platforms called `nexus`. The Windows
platform equivalent is called `nexus.exe`. To start Nexus on a Unix-like platform like Linux use

[subs="attributes"]
----
./nexus-{version-exact}/bin/nexus run
----

Starting Nexus with the `run` command will leave Nexus running in the current shell and display the log output.

Nexus is fully started once you see a message like the following in the log:

[subs="attributes"]
----
Started Sonatype Nexus OSS {version-exact}
----

In order to shut down Nexus running via the `run` command, you have to press `CTRL-C`.

The `nexus` script can be used to manage Nexus as a background application on OSX and Unix with the `start`,
`stop`, `restart`, `force-reload` and `status` commands.

Once the repository manager is started you can access the user interface as details in <<access>>.

[[installation-installer]]
===  Installing and Running with the Installer Application

The installer applications can be used as an alternative to the bundle archive installation process
documented in <<installation-archive>>.

You can start the installer application following these operating system-specific steps:

Windows::  Start the `.exe` by double-clicking on it.

OSX:: Extract the `.dmg` file by double-clicking on the file icon and then start the installer by double-clicking
on the `.app`.

Unix:: Run the `.sh` file in a command line window or double-clicking on it. This starts the installer
application user interface. Passing the `-c` option allows you to run the installer purely in the command line
window.

The installer application guides you through multiple steps to get Nexus installed:

Welcome:: Press 'Next' after reading the instructions to proceed.

Installation Type:: Select the edition of Nexus you want to install.

Destination Directory:: Configure the directory into which the Nexus application will be installed. The user
running the installer and the user that will run the Nexus application have to have full access to the specified
directory.

Data Directory:: Configure the directory for all the data stored by Nexus including configuration, repository and
component data.

Options:: Configure 'HTTP', 'JVM' and 'Service'-related aspects. The 'HTTP' configuration allows you to configure
the 'HTTP Port', the 'HTTP Host' and the 'Context Path'. 
+
The port defaults to 8081 and can be set to any available port in your organization. The host defaults to 0.0.0.0,
which means that Nexus will be available via any IP number assigned to the server. The context path defaults to
the root context, but can be configured to other paths such as `/nexus`.
+
The 'JVM'  configuration includes 'Initial Heap' and 'Maximum Heap' parameters. The 'Select JVM' checkbox allows
you to activate an additional setup step, that will allow you to use a specific JVM installation instead of the
bundled JVM.
+ 
The 'Service' configuration allows you to start the Nexus repository manager as part of the installation process.

License Agreement::  Read and accept the license agreement with the checkbox and press 'Install' to proceed.

After the extraction of all required assets into the configured directories a last step allows you to create a
desktop icon and open the application. Press 'Finish' to complete the installation.

If you selected to start the application, your web-browser will be started and the Nexus web interface detailed in
<<access>> will be accessible.

[[access]]
=== Accessing the Nexus User Interface

Once the repository manager is started, the application is listening on the configured IP address range and
port. By default any IP address and port 8081 are used. To access the Nexus web application, fire up a web browser
and type in the URL http://serveripaddress:port[http://serveripaddress:port]
e.g. http://localhost:8081/[http://localhost:8081/]. If Nexus started up successfully and network settings allow
you to connect to the server, the user interface looks similar to <<fig-nexus-ui-initial>>.

[[fig-nexus-ui-initial]]
.Initial Nexus User Interface
image::figs/web/ui-overview-anonymous.png[scale=45]

While we use +localhost+ throughout this documentation, you may need to use the IP Loopback Address of 
+127.0.0.1+, the IP address or the DNS hostname assigned to the machine running Nexus.

Next steps after successfully accessing the user interface are detailed in <<using>>, <<admin>> and following
chapters.

[[directories]]
=== Installation Directories

An installation of the Nexus repository manager includes a number of nested directories: 

[subs="attributes"]
----
$ ls -1 nexus-{version-exact} 
LICENSE.txt 
NOTICE.txt 
bin 
data 
deploy 
etc 
lib 
public
system
----

`LICENSE.txt and NOTICE.txt`:: contain legal details about the license and copyright notices.
`bin`::  contains the `nexus` startup script itself as well as startup-related  configuration files.
`data`:: This directory contains all of the repository and configuration data for Nexus. By default from an
archive bundle install, this directory is nested within the Nexus-installation directory. If you desire to
separate the application files from the actual data you can customize the location of the +data+ directory. This
can be achieved by setting the `nexus-work` property in the configuration file `etc/org.sonatype.nexus.cfg`
to an absolute path e.g. `nexus-work=/opt/nexus-data`.
//// 
TBD... should this be documented or is it needed or should it be removed from the product
`deploy`:: is empty. 
////
`etc` :: contains configuration files.
`lib` :: contains binary libraries related to Apache Karaf.
`public`:: contains public resources of the Nexus application.
`system`:: contains all components and plugins that constitute the Nexus application.


[[configure-runtime]]
=== Configuring the Runtime Environment for Nexus

Configuring the specifics of the repository manager runtime involves configuration for all components in various
configuration files and startup scripts. This section details these and provides recipes for specific tasks.

The startup of the JVM running Nexus is managed via files in the `bin` directory within the Nexus installation. 
Nexus startup is performed with the JVM configured via the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable and the configuration 
in the file `bin\setenv` .

The main location for further configuration files is the `etc` directory within the Nexus installation. It 
numerous files including specifically:

config.properties:: The main configuration for the Apache Karaf runtime. This file should 'not' be modified.

custom.properties:: Customizable configuration used by Apache Karaf. This file can be used to pass additional 
parameters to the Apache Karaf container.

jetty-*.xml:: A number of configuration files for Eclipse Jetty

org.apache.* and org.ops4j.*:: Various Karaf and OSGi related configuration files.

org.sonatype.nexus.cfg:: Main configuration file for the Nexus application allowing you to configure aspects 
such as ports used for HTTP and HTTPS access, location of the data and configuration storage as well as the 
context path and host.

system.properties:: Configuration parameters used for the JVM and application start up.
