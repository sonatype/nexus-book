[[install]]
== Installation and Running

[[install-introduction]]
=== Introduction

{nxrm} is a Java application that requires a Java Runtime Environment. When you run {nxrm}, you are running
a server application with a web-based user interface.  The application itself runs with the Eclipse Jetty servlet
container and Apache Karaf OSGi-container.

Installation is a simple process. This chapter provides further details to get started and keep the repository
manager running successfully in production deployments.

[[install-sect-downloading]]
=== Downloading

{nxrm} can be downloaded from http://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-oss[Sonatype]. Distributions are available 
for the 64-bit versions for Apple OSX, Microsoft Windows and Unix/Linux. They contain all necessary resources to 
install and run the repository manager. You can download the plain archive file for your operating system of a specific release version.

The plain archive files are Gzip TAR (TGZ) or ZIP files and are suitable for installation without a graphical user
interface purely using command line-based interaction. The file names include operating system qualifiers and are
similar to similar to:

[subs="attributes"]
----
nexus-{version-exact}-mac.tgz 
nexus-{version-exact}-unix.tar.gz
nexus-{version-exact}-win64.zip
----

Next steps, after a successful download, depend on the operating system you are using and are documented in
<<installation-archive>>.

[[installation-java]]
=== Java Runtime Environment

{nxrm} requires a Java 8 Runtime Environment (JRE) from Oracle. The distributions for OSX and Windows include
suitable runtime environments for the specific operating system. The distributions for Unix do not include the
runtime environment.

If you prefer to use an external runtime or use a Unix operating system, it is recommended to use the latest 
version of Java 8 available from the http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Oracle 
website]. You can choose to install the full JDK or the JRE only.


You can confirm the installed Java version with the `java` command:

----
$  java -version
java version "1.8.0_60"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_60-b27)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.60-b23, mixed mode)
----

When multiple JDK or JRE versions are installed, you need to ensure the correct version is configured by running
the above command as the operating system user, that is used to run the repository manager. This allows you to
have a dedicated runtime environment for the repository manager installed that is not on the path and not used by
other installed applications. It allows you to separate upgrades of the Java runtime used by the repository
manager from upgrades of the runtime used by other applications.

TIP: OpenJDK or other Java distributions or older Java versions are not supported.

Potentially you need to update the configuration to specify a specific JDK or JRE installation path:

To set the path for a specific Java location open the +bin/nexus+ script and locate the line
+INSTALL4J_JAVA_HOME_OVERRIDE+. Remove the hash and specify the location of your JDK/JRE:

----
INSTALL4J_JAVA_HOME_OVERRIDE=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle
---- 

The startup script verifies the runtime environment by checking for the existance of the nested `bin/java` command
as well as major and minor version of the runtime to be the required `1.8`. If the configured runtime is not
suitable, it will proceed with a best effort to locate a suitable runtime configured on the path or via the
`JAVA_HOME` environment variable. If successful, it will start up the repository manager with this JVM.

[[installation-archive]]
===  Installing and Running with the Distribution Archive

The distribution archives combine the application and all required resources in an archive file. Installing and
running {nxrm} is straightforward. Simply unpack the archive in a directory, to which you have full access.

If you are installing the repository manager on a local workstation to give it a test run, you can install it in
your home directory or wherever you like. {nxrm} doesn't have any hard-coded directories and will run from any
directory.

You can extract the archive ZIP for Windows with any archiving tool like http://www.7-zip.org/download.html[7zip]
or on the command line with e.g.  

[subs="attributes"]
----
$ 7za.exe e nexus-{version-exact}-win64.zip
----

On Windows you should install the repository manager outside +Program Files+ to avoid problems with Windows file
registry virtualization. If you plan to run the repository manager as a specific user you can install it into the
+AppData\Local+ directory of that users home directory. Otherwise simply use e.g., +C:\nexus+ or something
similar, ensuring that the user running the application has full access.

On OSX or Linux the downloaded GZip’d TAR archive can be extracted with:

[subs="attributes"]
----
$ tar xvzf nexus-{version-exact}-mac.tgz
$ tar xvzf nexus-{version-exact}-unix.tar.gz
----

You install the repository manager in a directory other than your users home directory. On a
Unix machine common practice is to use `/opt`.

The extraction process creates a directory with a number of directories inside. This directory is referred to as
the 'installation directory'.  In contains the application and related resources as well as the 'data directory'
for component and repository storage. Further details about these folders can be found in <<directories>>

The `bin` folder contains the generic startup scripts for Unix-like platforms called `nexus`. The Windows platform
equivalent is called `nexus.exe`. To start the repository manager from the `bin` folder on a Unix-like platform
like Linux use

----
./nexus run
----

The equivalent invocation on Windows requires a `/` in front of the `run` and any other commands.

----
nexus.exe /run
----

Starting the repository manager with the `run` command will leave it running in the current shell and display the
log output.

The repository manager is fully started once you see a message similar to the following in the log:

[subs="attributes"]
----
Started {nxrm} {version-exact}
----

In order to shut down the repository manager running via the `run` command, you have to press `CTRL-C`.

The `nexus` script can be used to manage the repository manager as a background application on OSX and Unix with
the `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `force-reload` and `status` commands. The Windows `nexus.exe` command supports
similar commands with a prefix of `/` e.g., `/run`.

Once the repository manager is started you can access the user interface as details in <<access>>.

[[installation-docker]]
=== Installing with Docker

{inall}

Docker automates the deployment of applications inside virtualized Linux containers. You can create a container 
that supports the installation of {pro} and {oss}.

To install the repository manager with a Docker image, follow the steps at 
https://hub.docker.com/r/sonatype/nexus3/[Docker Hub].
	
[[installation-upgrading]]
=== Upgrading

Since the repository manager separates its configuration and data storage from the application, it is easy to 
upgrade an existing installation.

To keep the upgrade simple schedule downtime to preserve important directories during the process. Follow the 
steps in the support https://support.sonatype.com/hc/en-us/articles/217967608[knowledge base article].

NOTE: Upgrading to {oss} 3.0.0 can only be performed by users who run the milestone 7 release of the repository 
manager. Be sure to manually back up the milestone 7 data directory to another location. It is a crucial step to 
properly upgrade the application.

[[configure-service]]
=== Configuring as a Service

{inall}

When installing {nxrm} for production usage it has to be configured it to run as a service, so it restarts
after the server reboots. It is good practice to run that service or daemon as a specific user that has only the
required access rights.

Installation from the <<installation-archive,distribution archive>> does not include the configuration of a
service. The following sections provide instructions for configuring the service manually. Independent of the
operating system the steps are

- Create operating sytem user with limited access rights dedicated to run the repository manager as a service 
- Ensure suitable Java runtime environment is installed - see <<installation-java>>
- Configure the service and ensure it starts as part of the operating sytem boot process

[[nonrootuser]]
WARNING: We recommend to avoid running the repository manager as the `root` user or a similar privileged user, as
this practice poses serious, unnecessary security risks to the host operating system. Instead we suggest to
follow system administration best practice and use a service specific user with the minimum required access rights
only.

[[service-linux]]
==== Setting up as a Service on Linux

You can configure the repository manager to run as a service with +init.d+ or +systemd+. Both are startup 
frameworks used in Linux-based systems such as Ubuntu and CentOS. They are, essentially, initscripts that 
load commands to manage the repository manager daemon. 

Before running the service configure an absolute path for your repository manager files. Then create a +nexus+ 
user with sufficient access rights to run the service.

Change +NEXUS_HOME+ to the absolute folder location in your +.bashrc+ file, then save.
----
NEXUS_HOME="/opt/nexus"
----

In +bin/nexus.rc+ assign the user between the quotes in the line below.

----
run_as_user="nexus"
----

If you use +init.d+ instead of +systemd+, symlink +$NEXUS_HOME/bin/nexus+ to +/etc/init.d/nexus+:

----
sudo ln -s $NEXUS_HOME/bin/nexus /etc/init.d/nexus
----

[[run-service]]
===== Running the Service


*chkconfig.*

This example uses +chkconfig+, a tool that targets the initscripts in +init.d+ to run the +nexus+ service. Run 
these commands to activate the service:

----
cd /etc/init.d
sudo chkconfig --add nexus
sudo chkconfig --levels 345 nexus on
sudo service nexus start
----

The second command adds nexus as a service to be started and stopped with the command. +chkconfig+ manages the 
symbolic links in +/etc/rc[0-6].d+ which control the services to be started and stopped when the operating system 
restarts or transitions between run-levels. The third command adds nexus to run-levels 3, 4, and 5. Then the 
service command starts the repository manager.

*update-rc.d.*

This example uses +update-rc.d+, a tool similar to the +chkconfig+.

----
cd /etc/init.d
sudo update-rc.d nexus defaults
sudo service nexus start
----

In the second line you will run a default priority to add the +nexus+ service before starting it.

*systemd.*

This example is a script that uses +systemd+ to run the repository manager service. Create a file called 
+nexus.service+. Add the following contents, then save the file in the +/etc/systemd/system/+ directory.

----
[Unit]
Description=nexus service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=/etc/systemd/system/nexus start
ExecStop=/etc/systemd/system/nexus stop
User=nexus
Restart=on-abort

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
----

Activate the service with the following commands:
----
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable nexus.service
sudo systemctl start nexus.service
----

After starting the service for any Linux-based operating systems, verify that the service started successfully.

----
tail -f /opt/nexus/data/log/nexus.log
----

The tail command verifies that the service has been started successfully. If successful, you should see a message 
notifying you that it is listening for HTTP.

[[service-windows]]
==== Running as a Service on Windows

The startup script that runs {pro} and {oss} on Windows platforms is +bin/nexus.exe+. The script includes standard
commands for starting and stopping the service. It also contains commands +install+ and +uninstall+ to create and
delete the configuration for the service.

You can create the service configuration with:

----
nexus.exe /install
----

The created service is available named 'nexus' in common console application to manage services such as Windows
Services. You can start, stop and restart the service there as well as configure it to start as part of a
operating system startup.

[[service-osx]]
====  Running as a Service on Mac OS X

The standard way to run a service on Mac OS X is to use +launchd+, a program that starts, stops and manages 
daemons and scripts in Apple OS X environments. To run the service you need to create an XML document 
called with the file extension +.plist+ to define its properties. An example plist file for the repository 
manager installed in +/opt+ is shown <<ex-nexus-plist>>.

[[ex-nexus-plist]]
.A sample com.sonatype.nexus.plist file
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" 
    "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.sonatype.nexus</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/opt/nexus/bin/nexus</string>
        <string>start</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
----

After saving the file as +com.sonatype.nexus.plist+ in
+/Library/LaunchDaemons/+ you have to change the ownership and access
rights.

----
sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.sonatype.nexus.plist
sudo chmod 644 /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.sonatype.nexus.plist
----


TIP: Consider setting up a different user to run the repository manager and adapt
permissions and the RUN_AS_USER setting in the +nexus+ startup script.
 
With this setup the repository managers, starts as a service at boot time. To
manually start it after the configuration you can use

----
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.sonatype.nexus.plist
----

[[reverse-proxy]]
=== Running Behind a Reverse Proxy

{inall}

{nxrm} is a sophisticated server application with a web-application user interface, answering 
HTTP requests using the high-performance servlet container http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/[Eclipse Jetty].

Organizations are sometimes required to run applications like {nxrm} behind a 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy[reverse proxy]. Reasons may include:

* security and auditing concerns
* network administrator familiarity
* organizational policy
* disparate application consolidation
* virtual hosting
* exposing applications on restricted ports
* SSL termination

This section provides some general guidance on how to configure common reverse proxy servers to work with {nxrm}. 
Always consult your reverse proxy administrator to ensure you configuration is secure.

The default webapp context path for the repository manager user interface is +8081+. In the instance 
where the repository manager needs to be proxied at a different base path you must change the default path by 
editing a property value. In <<admin-base-url>> follow the steps to change or update the base URL if you want an 
alternate server name.

In the following examples, review the sections on changing the <<config-http-port,HTTP port>> and 
<<config-context-path,context path>> to properly reverse-proxy the repository manager.

==== Example: Reverse Proxy on Restricted Ports

*Scenario*: You need to expose the repository manager on restricted port 80. The repository manager should not be 
run with the root user. Instead run your reverse proxy on the restricted port 80 and the repository manager on 
the default port +8081+. End users will access the repository manager using the virtual host URL 
http://www.example.com/nexus instead of http://localhost:8081/nexus.

Ensure your external hostname (+www.example.com+) routes to your reverse proxy server. In this example use the 
default content path (+/+)

*Apache httpd.*

----
ProxyRequests Off
ProxyPreserveHost On

<VirtualHost: *:80>
  ServerName www.example.com
  ServerAdmin admin@example.com
  ProxyPass /nexus http://localhost:8081/
  ProxyPassReverse /nexus http://localhost:8081/

	server {
		listen   *:80;
		server_name  www.example.com;

		# allow large uploads of files - refer to nginx documentation
		client_max_body_size 1G;

		# optimize downloading files larger than 1G - refer to nginx doc before adjusting

			proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
			proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
		}
	}
}
----

==== Example: Reverse Proxy Virtual Host at Custom Context Path

*Scenario:* You need to expose the repository manager using a custom host name +repo.example.com+ on a restricted 
port at a base path of +/nexus+.

Ensure your external hostname (+repo.example.com+) routes to your reverse proxy server and edit the webapp path 
a slash at end (+/+).

*Apache httpd.*

----

			proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
			proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
		}
	}
)
----

==== Example: Reverse Proxy SSL Termination at Base Path

*Scenario:* Your organization has standardized a reverse proxy to handle SSL certificates and termination. The 
reverse proxy virtual host will accept HTTPS requests on the standard port +443+ and serve content from the 
repository manager running on the default non-restricted HTTP port +8081+ transparently to end users.

Ensure your external host name (+repo.example.com+) routes to your reverse proxy server and edit the webapp path 
to be slash (+/+). 

To test your configuration, review the steps to
https://support.sonatype.com/hc/en-us/articles/213465768-SSL-Certificate-Guide[generate a self-signed SSL 
certificate] for reverse proxy servers.

*Apache httpd.* Ensure Apache httpd is loading +mod_ssl+.

http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/configuring_https_servers.html#compatibility[ssl compatibility])

[[access]]
=== Accessing the User Interface

Once the repository manager is started, the application is listening on the configured IP address range and
port. By default any IP address and port 8081 are used. To access the web application user interface, fire up a
web browser and type in the URL http://serveripaddress:port[http://serveripaddress:port]
e.g. http://localhost:8081/[http://localhost:8081/]. If the repository manager started up successfully and network
settings allow you to connect to the server, the user interface looks similar to <<fig-nexus-ui-initial>>.

[[fig-nexus-ui-initial]]
.Initial User Interface
image::figs/web/ui-overview-anonymous.png[scale=45]

While the documentation uses +localhost+ throughout, you may need to use the IP Loopback Address of
+127.0.0.1+, the IP address or the DNS hostname assigned to the machine running the repository manager.

The user interface shows the features available to an anonymous user. The repository manager installation includes
an administrative user with full access. Its username is 'admin' and the password is 'admin123'. You can sign in
with the button on the top right corner of the user interface.

Next steps after successfully accessing the user interface are detailed in <<using>>, <<admin>> and following
chapters about various repository formats and tools such as:

* <<maven>>
* <<nuget>>
* <<docker>>
* <<npm>>
* <<bower>>
* <<raw>>

More information about security related topics can be found in <<security>>.

[[directories]]
=== Directories

There are two main directories created and used by the repository manager.

Installation directory:: This directory is contains the Nexus Repository Manager application and all the required
additional components such as Java libraries and configuration files. The name of the directory by default uses
`nexus-` and is appended with the version name. In this documentation it is referred to as `$install-dir` in any
code segments.

Data Directory:: This directory contains all the repositories, components and other data that is being stored and
managed by the repository manager. It is located within the installation directory by default for archive-based
installs and called `data`. In this documentation it is referred to as `$data-dir` in any code segments.

[[installation-directory]]
==== Installation Directory

The installation directory includes a number of nested directories:

[subs="attributes"]
----
$ ls -1 nexus-{version-exact} 
LICENSE.txt 
NOTICE.txt 
bin 
data 
deploy 
etc 
lib 
public
system
----

`LICENSE.txt and NOTICE.txt`:: contain legal details about the license and copyright notices.

`bin`::  contains the `nexus` startup script itself as well as startup-related  configuration files.

`data`:: This 'data directory' contains all of the repository and configuration data. By default, from a
distribution archive install, this directory is nested within the installation directory. More details can be
found <<data-directory>>.

//// 
TBD... should this be documented or is it needed or should it be removed from the product
`deploy`:: is empty. 
////

`etc` :: contains configuration files.

`lib` :: contains binary libraries related to Apache Karaf.

`public`:: contains public resources of the  application.

`system`:: contains all components and plugins that constitute the application.


[[data-directory]]
==== Data Directory

The data directory contains subdirectories such as `blobs`, `db`, `elasticsearch` and others. These contain all
the components, repository, configuration and other data presented by the repository manager.

[[configure-runtime]]
=== Configuring the Runtime Environment

Configuring the specifics of the repository manager runtime involves configuration for all components in various
configuration files and startup scripts. This section details these and provides recipes for specific tasks.

The startup of the JVM running the repository manager is managed via files in the `$install-dir/bin` directory
within the installation.  The application startup is performed with the JVM configuration in the file
`$install-dir/bin/nexus.vmoptions` :

----
-Xms1200M
-Xmx1200M
-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions
-XX:+UnsyncloadClass
-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true
-Dkaraf.home=.
-Dkaraf.base=.
-Dkaraf.etc=etc
-Djava.util.logging.config.file=etc/java.util.logging.properties
-Dkaraf.data=data
-Djava.io.tmpdir=data/tmp
-Dkaraf.startLocalConsole=false
----

The main location for configuration files is the `etc` directory. The directory includes:

config.properties:: The main configuration for the Apache Karaf runtime. This file should 'not' be modified.

custom.properties:: Customizable configuration used by Apache Karaf. This file can be used to pass additional 
parameters to the Apache Karaf container.

jetty-*.xml:: A number of configuration files for Eclipse Jetty

org.apache.* and org.ops4j.*:: Various Karaf and OSGi related configuration files.

org.sonatype.nexus.cfg:: Main configuration file for the application allowing you to configure aspects 
such as ports used for HTTP and HTTPS access, location of the data and configuration storage as well as the 
context path and host.

system.properties:: Configuration parameters used for the JVM and application start up.

[[config-jvm]]
==== Updating Memory Allocation and other JVM Paramaters

The default and maximum heap sizes for the repository manager are a value of `1200M`, suitable for most usage
patterns. As a Java application running on the JVM the repository manager is using JVM configuration parameters
for numerous settings as part of the startup parameters for the JVM. These values are defined in the configuration
file `$install-dir/bin/nexus.vmoptions`. Increased memory configuration can be set with e.g. :

----
-Xms1500M
-Xmx2G
----

Other JVM parameters such as GC algorithm can be configured in the same location.

[[config-http-port]]
==== Changing the HTTP Port

The default value for the HTTP port used to access the repository manager user interface and resources is
`8081`. Therefore the user interface would be available at `http://localhost:8081/`. To change or update the port 
locate the line `application-port=8081` in `$install-dir/etc/org.sonatype.nexus.cfg`, then edit the number. Here 
is an example where you would change the port to `9081`:

----
application-port=9081
----

Therefore, the exposed URL will be `http://localhost:9081/`.

[[config-context-path]]
==== Changing the Context Path

To change or update the context path in the instance you want point to a specific webapp or component, locate  
the `nexus-context-path=/` line in `$install-dir/etc/org.sonatype.nexus.cfg`. Here is an example where you 
expose the user interface to a `components` directory.

----
nexus-context-path=/components/
----

Therefore, if the port is set to `9081`, the exposed URL will be `http://localhost:9081/components/`.

[[config-data-directory]]
==== Configuring the Data Directory Location

<<installation-archive,Distribution archive installation>> of the repository manager configures the location of
the <<data-directory, data directory>> to be nested inside the application directory. 

The configuration of this folder is located in `$install-dir/bin/nexus.vmoptions`. For example, if you want
to use the absolute path `/opt/repository/storage/`, you have to change to:

----
-Dkaraf.data=/opt/repository/storage
-Djava.io.tmpdir=/opt/repository/storage/tmp
----

[[uninstall]]
=== Uninstalling

To uninstall the repository manager from an archive installation, remove the service configuration and 
delete the entire directory.
