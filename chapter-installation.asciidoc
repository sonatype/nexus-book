== Installing and Running {pro}

{inall}

[[prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites

{pro} only has one prerequisite, a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) compatible with Java 7 or Java 8. {pro} and
{oss} is most often run with the JRE that is bundled with a Java Development Kit (JDK) installation. The main
supported Java distribution is the Oracle version.

To download the Oracle JDK, go to http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html . At a
minimum Java 7u2 is required, but we recommend to use the latest available version.

[[downloading]]
=== Downloading

There are two distributions of the {pro}: http://nexus.sonatype.org/[{oss}] 
and http://links.sonatype.com/products/nexus/pro/home[{pro}].  {oss} is a fully-featured repository
manager which can be freely used, customized, and distributed under
the Eclipse Public License (EPL Version 1). {pro} is a
distribution with features that are relevant to large
enterprises and organizations which require complex procurement and
staging workflows in addition to more advanced LDAP integration,
Atlassian Crowd support, and other development infrastructure. The
differences are explored in <<intro>>.

==== Downloading {oss}

To download the latest {oss} distribution, go to http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/go[http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/go]
and choose 'Nexus (TGZ)' or 'Nexus (ZIP)' shown in <<fig-installing-open-source-dl>>. This will download a Gzip TAR (TGZ)
or a ZIP with identical contents. Your download will be file named +nexus-{version-exact}-bundle.zip+ or
+nexus-{version-exact}-bundle.tar.gz+.

==== Downloading {pro}

{pro} can be downloaded as +zip+ or +tar.gz+ archive from
http://links.sonatype.com/products/nexus/pro/download[the {pro} support download page]. Existing customers with access to the support
system can also download it directly from the
http://links.sonatype.com/products/nexus/pro/support[{pro} Support landing page].

TIP: Use the http://www.sonatype.com/nexus/free-trial[{pro} trial
version] for an evaluation.

[[installing]]
===  Installing

The following instructions are for installing {oss} or {pro} as a stand-alone server. {pro} and {oss} are bundled
with a Jetty instance that listens to all configured IP addresses on a host (0.0.0.0) and runs on port 8081 by
default.

Installing the repository is straightforward. Unpack the web application archive in a directory. If you are
installing the repository manager on a local workstation to give it a test run, you can install it in your home
directory or wherever you like. {pro} and {oss} do not have any hard coded directories. It will run from any
directory. If you downloaded the ZIP

[subs="attributes"]
----
$ unzip nexus-{version-exact}-bundle.zip
----

And, if you download the GZip'd TAR archive, run:

[subs="attributes"]
----
$ tar xvzf nexus-{version-exact}-bundle.tar.gz
----

For {pro} the equivalent commands would be 

[subs="attributes"]
----
$ unzip nexus-professional-{version-exact}-bundle.zip
$ tar xvzf nexus-professional-{version-exact}-bundle.tar.gz
----

CAUTION: There are some known incompatibilities with the version of the tar command provided by Solaris and the
GZip TAR format. If you are installing {pro} on Solaris, you must use the GNU tar application, or you will end up
with corrupted files.

NOTE: If you are installing the repository manager on a server, you might want to use a directory other than your
home directory. On a Unix machine, this book assumes that it is installed in +/usr/local/nexus-{version-exact}+
with a symbolic link +/usr/local/nexus+ to the +nexus+ directory. Using a generic symbolic link +nexus+ to a
specific version is a common practice which makes it easier to upgrade when a newer version is made available.

[subs="attributes"]
----
$ sudo cp nexus-{version-exact}-bundle.tar.gz /usr/local
$ cd /usr/local
$ sudo tar xvzf nexus-{version-exact}-bundle.tar.gz
$ sudo ln -s nexus-{version-exact} nexus
----

Although it isn't required to run, you may want to set an environment variable NEXUS_HOME in your environment that
points to the installation directory. This chapter will refer to this location as +$NEXUS_HOME+.

NOTE: On Windows you should install the repository manager outside +Program Files+ to avoid problems with Windows
file registry virtualization. If you plan to run the repository manager as a specific user you could install into
the +AppData\Local+ directory of that users home directory. Otherwise simply go with e.g., +C:\nexus+ or something
similar.

The installation directory +nexus-{version-exact}+ or +nexus-professional-{version-exact}+ has a sibling directory
named +sonatype-work+. This directory contains all of the repository and configuration data and is stored outside
of the installation directory to make it easier to upgrade to a newer version.

By default, this directory is always a sibling to the installation directory. If you installed the repository
manager in the +/usr/local+ directory it would also contain a +sonatype-work+ subdirectory with a nested +nexus+
directory containing all of the content and configuration. The location of the +sonatype-work+ directory can be
customized by altering the nexus-work property in +$NEXUS_HOME/conf/nexus.properties+.

[[upgrading]]
=== Upgrading

Since the repository manager separates its configuration and data storage from the application, it is easy to
upgrade an existing installation.

To upgrade the repository manager, unpack the archive in the directory that contains the existing
installation. Once the archive is unpacked, the new application directory should be a sibling to your existing
+sonatype-work/+ directory.

If you have defined a symbolic link for the version of the repository manager to use, stop the server and change
that to point at the new application directory. When you start the new instance it will read the existing
repository configuration from the +sonatype-work+ directory.  Depending on the version you upgrade from and to,
some maintenance tasks like rebuilding the internal indices can be necessary. Please refer to the
http://links.sonatype.com/products/nexus/oss/upgrading[upgrade notes] of the new release for more information on
this. In addition, a review of the http://links.sonatype.com/products/nexus/oss/release-notes[release notes] can
be very useful to get a better understanding of potential, additional steps required.

If you are using any additional plugins supplied by Sonatype, the new version you downloaded will contain a newer
version of the plugin. Be sure to copy the new version from the +optional-plugins+ folder to the
+plugin-repository+ folder, as documented in <<install-additional-plugins>>, and restart the repository manager.

Externally supplied plugins are updated by simply replacing the folder with the plugin with the new version.

This automatic upgrade of the repository manager works for nearly all update ranges. All 2.x versions can directly
upgrade to the latest version. All 1.x version can upgrade to 2.7.x maximum. If you need to upgrade from 1.x to a
newer version, you need to perform an intermediate upgrade step to a 2.x version.

NOTE: The same upgrade process can be used to change from {oss} to {pro}.

[[running]]
=== Running

When you start the repository manager, you are starting a web server on the default port +0.0.0.0:8081+. It runs
within a servlet container called Eclipse Jetty, and it is started with a native service wrapper called the
http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/doc/english/introduction.html[Tanuki Java Service Wrapper]. This service wrapper
can be configured to run the repository manager as a Windows service or a Unix daemon. {pro} and {oss} ship with
generic startup scripts for Unix-like platforms called +nexus+ and for Windows platforms called +nexus.bat+ in the
+$NEXUS_HOME/bin+ folder. To start the repository manager on a Unix-like platform like Linux, MacOSX or Solaris
use

----
cd /usr/local/nexus
./bin/nexus console
----

Similarly, starting on Windows can be done with the +nexus.bat+ file. Starting the repository manager with the
`console` command will leave it running in the current shell and display the log output.

On Unix systems, you can start the repository manager detached from the starting shell with the start command even
when not yet installed as a service.

----
./bin/nexus start
----

When executed you should see a feedback message and then you can follow
the startup process viewing the log file +logs/wrapper.log+
changes.  
[subs="attributes"]
----
Starting {pro}...
Started {pro}.
$ tail -f logs/wrapper.log 
----

At this point, the repository manager will be running and listening on all IP addresses (0.0.0.0) that are
configured for the current host on port 8081. To use the user interface, fire up a web browser and type in the URL
http://localhost:8081/nexus[http://localhost:8081/nexus]. You should see the user interface as displayed in
<<fig-installing-nexus-default-screen>>.

While we use +localhost+ throughout this book, you may need to use the IP Loopback Address of +127.0.0.1+, the IP
address or the DNS hostname assigned to the machine running the repository manager.

When first starting {pro} you are presented with a form that allows you to request a trial activation. This page
displayed in <<fig-installing-trial-form>> contains a link to the license activation screen in
<<fig-installing-license-activation>>.

[[fig-installing-trial-form]]
.Trial Activation Form
image::figs/web/installing-trial-form.png[scale=50]

After submitting the form for your trial activation, you will receive a
license key via email that you can use in the license activation screen to
activate {pro}. If you already have a license key or
license file, you can use the same screen to upload the file and
register your license.

[[fig-installing-license-activation]]
.License Activation 
image::figs/web/installing-license-activation.png[scale=50]

Once you have agreed to the End User License Agreement you will be
directed to the {pro} Welcome screen displayed in
<<fig-installing-pro-eval-welcome>>.

[[fig-installing-pro-eval-welcome]]
.{pro} Welcome Screen 
image::figs/web/installing-pro-eval-welcome.png[scale=50]

Click on the 'Log In' link in the upper
right-hand corner of the web page, and you should see the login dialog
displayed in <<fig-installing-nexus-login-dialog>>. 

TIP: The default administrator username and password combination is
+admin+ and +admin123+.

[[fig-installing-nexus-login-dialog]]
.Log In Dialog (default login/password is admin/admin123)
image::figs/web/installing-nexus-login-dialog.png[scale=50]

When you are logged into your evaluation version of {pro},
you will see some helpful links to the {pro} Evaluation Guide,
Sample Projects and the Knowledgebase below the search input on the
Welcome screen.

With a full license for {pro} these links will be removed and you will get the application window displayed in
<<fig-installing-nexus-default-screen>>.

{oss} will not need to be activated with a license key and will display a number of links to resources and support
on the Welcome screen to logged in users.

The files from Java Service Wrapper used for the start up process can
be found in +$NEXUS_HOME/bin/jsw+ and are separated into generic
files like the +wrapper.conf+ configuration file in conf and a
number of libraries in +lib+. An optional +wrapper.conf+ include
allows you to place further configuration optionally in
+$NEXUS_HOME/conf/wrapper-override.conf+.


The platform-specific directories are available for backwards
compatibility with older versions only and should not be used. A full
list of directories follows:

----
$ cd /usr/local/nexus/bin/jsw
$ ls -1                                                                             
conf

macosx-universal-32
macosx-universal-64
solaris-sparc-32
solaris-sparc-64
solaris-x86-32
windows-x86-32
windows-x86-64
----

The +wrapper.conf+ file is the central configuration file for the startup of the Jetty servlet container running
the repository manager on a Java virtual machine and therefore includes configuration for things such as the java
command to use, Java memory configuration, logging configuration and other settings documented in the
configuration file.

Typical modifications include adapting the maximum memory size to your server hardware and usage requirements
e.g. 2000 MB up from the default 768 and other JVM related configurations.

----
wrapper.java.maxmemory=2000
----

You can configure JSW to use a specific Java installation and not just
the Java command found on the `PATH` by setting `JAVA_HOME` in the
`wrapper.conf` file and using it for the startup command.

----
set.JAVA_HOME=/opt/jdk1.8.0_40/
wrapper.java.command=%JAVA_HOME%/bin/java
----

A typical use case is using a custom installation of the Oracle JDK 
instead of OpenJDK that is preinstalled as part of the Linux 
distribution. 

Additional configuration in the +wrapper.conf+ file includes activation of further Jetty configuration file for
monitoring the repository manager via <<jmx, JMX>> or using <<ssl-sect-ssl-direct,HTTPS>>.


TIP: The startup script +nexus+ supports the common service
commands +start+, +stop+, +restart+, +status+,
+console+ and +dump+.

[[install-sect-repoman-post-install]]
=== Post-Install Checklist

{pro} and {oss} ship with some default passwords and settings for repository indexing that need to be changed for
your installation to be useful (and secure). After installing and running the repository manager, you need to make
sure that you complete the following tasks:

==== Step 1: Change the Administrative Password and Email Address

The administrative password defaults to 'admin123'. The first thing you should do to your new installation is
change this password. To change the administrative password, login as 'admin' with the password 'admin123', and
click on 'Change Password' under the 'Security' menu in the left-hand side of the browser window. For more
detailed instructions, see <<using-sect-user-profile>>.

==== Step 2: Configure the SMTP Settings

The repository manager can send username and password recovery emails. To enable this feature, you will need to
configure a SMTP Host and Port as well as any necessary authentication parameters that the repository manager
needs to connect to the mail server. To configure the SMTP settings, follow the instructions in
<<config-sect-smtp>>.

==== Step 3: Configure Default HTTP and HTTPS Proxy Settings

In many deployments the internet, and therefore any remote repositories that the repository manager needs to
proxy, can only be reached via a HTTP and HTTPS proxy server internal to the deployment company. In these cases
the connection details to that proxy server need to be configured, as documented in <<config-default-http-proxy>>
in order for the repository manager to be able to proxy remote repositories at all.

==== Step 4: Enable Remote Index Downloads

{pro} and {oss} ship with three important proxy repositories for the Maven Central repository, Apache Snapshot
repository, and the Codehaus Snapshot repository. Each of these repositories contains thousands (or tens of
thousands) of components and it would be impractical to download the entire contents of each. To that end, most
repositories maintain an index which catalogues the entire contents and provides for fast and efficient
searching. The repository manager uses these remote indexes to search for components, but we've disabled the index
download as a default setting. To download remote indexes:

. Click on 'Repositories' under the 'Views/Repositories' menu in the left-hand side of the browser window.

. Select each of the three proxy repositories and change 'Download
  Remote Indexes' to 'true' in the 'Configuration' tab. You'll need to load
  the dialog shown in <<fig-repo-config>> for each of
  the three repositories.

This will trigger the repository manager to re-index these repositories, during which the remote index files will
be downloaded. It might take a few minutes to download the entire index, but once you have it, you'll be able to
search the entire contents of the Maven repository.

Once you've enabled remote index downloads, you still will not be able to browse the complete contents of a remote
repository. Downloading the remote index allows you to search for components in a repository, but until you
download those components from the remote repository they will not show in the repository tree when you are
browsing a repository. When browsing a repository, you will only be shown components which have been downloaded
from the remote repository.

==== Step 5: Change the Deployment Password

The deployment user's password defaults to 'deployment123'. Change this password to make sure that only authorized
developers can deploy components to your installation. To change the deployment password, log in as an
administrator. Click on 'Security' to expand the security menu.  When the menu appears, click on 'Users'.  A list
of users will appear.  At that point, right-click on the user named 'Deployment' and select 'Set Password'.


==== Step 6: If Necessary, Set the LANG Environment Variable

If your repository manager needs to store configuration and data using an international character set, you should
set the +LANG+ environment variable. The Java Runtime will adapt to the value of the +LANG+ environment variable
and ensure that configuration data is saved using the appropriate character type. If you are starting the
repository manager as a service, place this environment variable in the startup script found in
+/etc/init.d/nexus+.

==== Step 7: Configure Routes

A route defines patterns used to define and identify the repositories in which the components
are searched for. Typically, internal components are not available in
the Central Repository or any other external, public repository. A route, as documented in
<<confignx-sect-managing-routes>>, should be configured so that any
requests for internal components do not leak to external repositories.


[[install-sect-service]]
=== Configuring {pro} as a Service

{inall}

When installing {pro} or {oss} for production usage you should configure it to run as a service, so it starts back
up after server reboots. It is good practice to run that service or daemon as a specific user that has only the
required access righs. The following sections provide instructions for configuring the repository manager as a
service or daemon on various operating systems.

==== Running as a Service on Linux

You can configure the repository manager to start automatically by copying the +nexus+ script to the +/etc/init.d+
directory. On a Linux system perform the following operations as the root user:

. Create a +nexus+ user with sufficient access rights to run the service

. Copy +$NEXUS_HOME/bin/nexus+ to +/etc/init.d/nexus+

. Make the +/etc/init.d/nexus+ script executable and owned by the root user -
+
----
chmod 755 /etc/init.d/nexus
chown root /etc/init.d/nexus
----



. Edit this script changing the following variables:

.. Change +NEXUS_HOME+ to the absolute folder location (e.g., 
+NEXUS_HOME="/usr/local/nexus"+)

.. Set the +RUN_AS_USER+ to +nexus+ or any other user with restricted
  rights that you want to use to run the service. You should not be
  running the repository manager as `root`.

.. Change +PIDDIR+ to a directory where this user has read/write
permissions. In most Linux distributions, +/var/run+ is only writable by
root. The property you need to add to customize the PID
file location is +wrapper.pidfile+. For more information about this
property and how it would be configured in wrapper.conf, see:
http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.com/doc/english/properties.html[http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.com/doc/english/properties.html].


. Change the owner and group of the directories used by the repository manager, including +nexus-work+ configured
in +nexus.properties+ defaulting to +sonatype-work/nexus+, to the +nexus+ user that will run the application.

. If Java is not on the default path for the user running the repository manager, add a +JAVA_HOME+ variable which
points to your local Java installation and add a +$JAVA_HOME/bin+ to the +PATH+.

ifdef::promo[]
++++
<?dbhtml-include href="promo_nexusService.html"?>
++++
endif::[]

[[nonrootuser]]
WARNING: We recommend to avoid running the repository manager as the `root` user or a similar privileged user, as
this practice poses serious security risks to the host operating system unnecessarily. Instead we suggest to
follow system administration best practice and use a service specific user with the minimum required access rights
only.

===== Run as a Service on Red Hat, Fedora, and CentOS

This script has the appropriate `chkconfig` directives, so all you need to do is to add the repository manager as
a service is run the following commands:

[subs="attributes"]
----
$ cd /etc/init.d
$ chkconfig --add nexus
$ chkconfig --levels 345 nexus on
$ service nexus start
Starting {pro}...
$ tail -f /usr/local/nexus/logs/wrapper.log
----

The second command adds +nexus+ as a service to be started and stopped with the +service+ command. +chkconfig+
manages the symbolic links in +/etc/rc[0-6].d+ which control the services to be started and stopped when the
operating system restarts or transitions between run-levels. The third command adds nexus to run-levels 3, 4,
and 5. The service command starts the repository manager, and the last command tails the wrapper.log to verify
that it has been started successfully. If the repository manager has started successfully, you should see a
message notifying you that it is listening for HTTP.

===== Runs as a Service on Ubuntu and Debian

The process for setting up the repository manager as a service on Ubuntu differs slightly from the process used on
a Red Hat variant. Instead of running +chkconfig+, you should run the following sequence of commands once you've
configured the startup script in +/etc/init.d+.

[subs="attributes"]
----
$ cd /etc/init.d
$ update-rc.d nexus defaults
$ service nexus start
Starting {pro}...
$ tail -f /usr/local/nexus/logs/wrapper.log
----

====  Running as a Service on Mac OS X

The standard way to run a service on Mac OS X is by using +launchd+, which uses plist files for configuration. An
example plist file for the repository manager installed in +/opt+ is shown <<ex-nexus-plist>>.

[[ex-nexus-plist]]
.A sample com.sonatype.nexus.plist file
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" 
    "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.sonatype.nexus</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/opt/nexus/bin/nexus</string>
        <string>start</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
----

After saving the file as +com.sonatype.nexus.plist+ in
+/Library/LaunchDaemons/+ you have to change the ownership and access
rights.

----
sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.sonatype.nexus.plist
sudo chmod 644 /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.sonatype.nexus.plist
----


TIP: Consider setting up a different user to run the repository manager and adapt
permissions and the RUN_AS_USER setting in the `nexus` startup script.
 
With this setup the repository managers, starts as a service at boot time. To
manually start it after the configuration you can use

----
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.sonatype.nexus.plist
----

==== Running as a Service on Windows

The startup script for the repository manager on Windows platforms is +bin/nexus.bat+. Besides the standard
commands for starting and stopping the service, it has the additional commands +install+ and +uninstall+. Running
these commands with elevated privileges will set up the service for you or remove it as desired. Once installed as
a service with the +install+ command, the batch file can be used to start and stop the service. In addition, the
service will be available in the usual Windows service management console as a service named 'nexus'.

[[install-sect-proxy]]
=== Running Behind a Reverse Proxy

{inall}

{pro} is a sophisticated server application with a web-application user interface, answering HTTP requests using
the high-performance servlet container http://eclipse.org/jetty[Eclipse Jetty].

Organizations are sometimes required to run applications like {pro} or {oss} behind a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy[reverse proxy]. Reasoning can include:

* security and auditing concerns
* network administrator familiarity
* organizational policy
* disparate application consolidation
* virtual hosting
* exposing applications on restricted ports
* SSL termination

We provide some general guidance on how to configure common reverse proxy servers to work with {pro} and
{oss}. Always consult your reverse proxy administrator to ensure you configuration is secure.

There are two main settings of the repository manager, which can affect how reverse proxies interact.

[[nexus_webapp_context_path]]
==== Webapp Context Path

The repository manager webapp context path is +/nexus+ by default. This means every URL path used to access the
repository manager must begin with +/nexus+.

In cases where the repository manager needs to be accessed at a different base path, through your reverse proxy or
directly, you must change the default path by editing a property value.

For example, to expose the repository manager in the root context ( +/+ ) instead of +/nexus/+:

. Edit +$NEXUS_HOME/conf/nexus.properties+. Change
  +nexus-webapp-context-path=/nexus+ to +nexus-webapp-context-path=/+

. Restart the repository manager and verify that it is available on +http://localhost:8081/+ and no longer
  available at +http://localhost:8081/nexus/+.

. Emails triggered by your repository manager may include absolute links back to the originating server. As a
  matter of courtesy, set the Base URL as shown in <<fig-config-administration-application-server>> under
  'Application Server Settings' to the URL that will be externally available to your users
  e.g. +http://repo.example.com/+.

==== Do Not Force Base URL

The _Administration_ -> _Server_ -> _Application Server Settings_ configuration to 'Force Base URL' feature. The
original use case for forcing base URL is no longer valid.

When enabled, the incoming request host and base path is ignored and the repository manager acts like it is being
accessed at the value of base URL.

WARNING: Do not enable the <<fig-config-administration-application-server>> 'Force Base URL' unless explicitly
advised by Sonatype - enabling this will most likely cause your repository manager to not work properly through a
reverse proxy.

==== Example: Reverse Proxy On Restricted Ports

.Scenario:

You need to expose the repository manager on restricted port 80. <<nonrootuser,The repository manager should not
be run with the root user>>. Instead run your reverse proxy on the restricted port +80+ and the repository manager
on the default port +8081+. End users will access the repository manager using the virtual host URL
+http://www.example.com/nexus+ instead of +http://localhost:8081/nexus+.

Ensure your external host name ( +www.example.com+ ) routes to your reverse
proxy server.

==== Example: Reverse Proxy Virtual Host at Base Path

.Scenario:

You need to expose the repository manager using a custom host name of +repo.example.com+ on a restricted port at a
base path of slash ( +/+ ).

Ensure your external host name ( +repo.example.com+ ) routes to your reverse proxy server and
<<nexus_webapp_context_path,edit the webapp path to be slash ( +/+ )>>.

==== Example: Reverse Proxy SSL Termination at Base Path

.Scenario:

Your organization has standardized on a reverse proxy to handle SSL certificates and termination. The reverse
proxy virtual host will accept HTTPS requests on the standard port +443+ and serve content from the repository
manager running on the default non-restricted HTTP port +8081+ transparently to end users.

Ensure your external host name ( +repo.example.com+ ) routes to your reverse proxy server and
<<nexus_webapp_context_path,edit the webapp path to be slash ( +/+ )>>.

To test your configuration, we offer a

[[install-sect-licensing]]
=== Installing a {pro} License

{inrmonly}

When starting a {pro} trial installation you can upload your
license file as described in <<running>> on the license
screen visible in <<fig-installing-license-activation>>.

If you are currently using an evaluation license or need to replace your
current license with a new one, click on Licensing in the
Administration menu. This will bring up the panel shown
in <<fig-installations-licensing>>. To upload your
{pro} license, click on Browse..., select the file, and
click on Upload.

[[fig-installations-licensing]]
.{pro} Licensing Panel
image::figs/web/repository-manager_license.png[scale=50] 

Once you have selected a license and uploaded it to the repository manager, {pro} will display a dialog box with
the {pro} End User License Agreement as shown in <<fig-installation-eula>>. If you agree with the terms and
conditions, click on "I Agree".

[[fig-installation-eula]]
.{pro} End User License Agreement
image::figs/web/installing_license_eula.png[scale=50] 

Once you have agreed to the terms and conditions contained in the End
User License Agreement, {pro} will then display a dialog
box confirming the installation of a {pro} license, as
shown in <<fig-installation-license-upload-config>>.

[[fig-installation-license-upload-config]]
.License Upload Finished Dialog
image::figs/web/installing_license_uploaded.png[scale=50]

If you need to remove your {pro} license, you can click on
the "Uninstall License" button at the bottom of the Licensing
Panel. Clicking on this button will show the dialog in
<<fig-installation-config-uninstall>>, confirming that you want to
uninstall a license.

[[fig-installation-config-uninstall]]
.Uninstall License Confirmation Dialog
image::figs/web/installing_uninstall_license.png[scale=50]

Clicking Yes in this dialog box will uninstall the license from {pro}
and display another dialog which confirms that the
license has been successfully uninstalled.

.License Uninstall Completed Dialog
image::figs/web/installing_uninstall_completed.png[scale=50]

Clicking on the 'Active Users Report' button shows a list of IP numbers that connected to the repository manager
in the last 7 days.

==== License Expiration

When a {pro} license expires, the user interface will have all functionality disabled except for the ability to
install a new license file.
 
[[install-sect-dirs]]
===  Directories

{inall}

The following sections describe the various directories that are a part of any {pro} and {oss} installation. When
you install {oss} or {pro}, you are creating two directories: a directory containing the runtime and application
often symlinked as +nexus+ and a directory containing your own configuration and data -
+sonatype-work/nexus+. When you upgrade to a newer version of {pro}, you replace the application directory and
retain all of your own custom configuration and repository data in +sonatype-work/+.

[[sect-installing-work-dir]]
==== Sonatype Work Directory

The Sonatype Work directory +sonatype-work+ is created as a sibling to
the +nexus+ application directory, and the location of this directory
can be configured via the +nexus.properties+ file which is described in
<<nexus-home-conf>>. 


The Sonatype Work directory +sonatype-work/nexus/+ contains a
number of subdirectories. Depending on the plugins installed and used,
some directories may or may be not present in your installation:

access/:: This directory contains a log of all IP addresses accessing the repository manager. The data can be
viewed by clicking on Active Users Report in the Administration - Licensing tab in the user interface.

aether-local-repository/ or maven2-local-repository:: This holds
temporary files created when running Maven dependency queries in the
user interface.

backup/:: If you have configured a scheduled job to back up configuration, this directory is going to contain a
number of ZIP archives that contain snapshots of the configuration.  Each ZIP file contains the contents of the
conf/ directory. (Automated backups are a feature of {pro}.)

broker/:: The broker directory and its subdirectories contains the
storage backend for the Smart Proxy messaging component.

conf/:: This directory contains the configuration.  Settings that define the list of repositories, the logging
configuration, the staging and procurement configuration, and the security settings are all captured in this
directory.

conf/keystore/:: Contains the automatically generated key used to identify this repository manager for Smart Proxy
usage

db/:: Contains the database storing the User Token information, if
that feature is enabled.

error-report-bundles/:: Used to contain the bundled archives of data
assembled for problem reporting. Since this feature has been removed
this folder can be safely deleted.

felix-cache/:: This directory holds the cache for the OSGi framework Apache Felix, which is used for the
repository manager plugin architecture.

health-check/:: Holds cached reports from the Repository Health Check plugin.

indexer/ and indexer-pro/:: Contains an index for all repositories and repository groups managed by repository
manager. An index is a Lucene index which is the standard for indexing and searching a Maven repository. The
repository manager maintains a local index for all repositories, and can also download an index from remote
repositories.

logs/:: The nexus.log file that contains information about a running instance of the repository manager. This
directory also contains archived copies of log files. Log files are rotated every day. To reclaim disk space, you
can delete old log files from the logs directory.

nuget/:: Contains the database supporting queries against NuGet repositories used for .NET package support.

p2/:: If you are using the P2 repository management features of {pro}, 
this directory contains a local cache of P2 repository components.

plugin-repository/:: This directory contains any additionally
installed plugins from third parties as documented in
<<install-additional-plugins>>.

proxy/:: Stores data about the files contained in a remote repository. Each proxy repository has a subdirectory in
the +proxy/attributes/+ directory and every file that the repository manager has interacted with in the remote
repository has an XML file that captures the last requested time stamp, the remote URL for a particular file, the
length of the file, the digests for a particular file, and others. If you need to backup the local cached contents
of a proxy repository, you should also back up the contents of the proxy repository's directory under
+proxy/attributes/+

storage/:: Stores components and metadata repositories. Each
repository is a subdirectory that contains the components in a
repository. If the repository is a proxy repository, the storage
directory will contain locally cached components from the remote
repository. If the repository is a hosted repository, the storage
directory will contain all components in the repository. If you need to
back-up the contents of a repository, you should back up the contents of
the storage directory.

support/:: The support zip archive documented in
<<support-tools>> is created and stored in this folder.  

template-store/:: Contains the Maven settings template files
documented in detail in <<maven-settings>>.

timeline/:: Contains an index that the repository manager uses to store events and other information to support
internal operations. The user interface exposes this data with the system feeds.

tmp/:: Folder used for temporary storage.

trash/:: If you have configured scheduled jobs to remove snapshot components or to delete other information from
repositories, the deleted data will be stored in this directory.  To empty this trash folder, view a list of
repositories, and then click on the Trash icon in the user interface.

The +conf/+ directory contains a number of files which allow for configuration and customization of the repository
manager. All of the files contained in this directory are altered by the administrative user interface. While you
can change the configuration settings contained in these files with a text editor, Sonatype recommends that you
modify the contents of these files using the administrative user interface. Depending on your version of the
repository manager and the installed plugins, the complete list of files may differ slightly.

broker.groovy:: A groovy script for configuring low-level properties
for Smart Proxy.

capabilities.xml:: Further Smart Proxy backend configuration.

healthcheck.properties:: Configuration for the Repository Health Check.

logback.properties, logback.xml and logback-*.xml:: Contains logging
configuration. If you need to customize the detail of log messages,
the frequency of log file rotation, or if you want to connect your
own custom logging appenders, you should edit the logback-nexus.xml
configuration file as desired. If you find log4j.properties files as
well, you can safely remove them since they are remnants from an old
version and are not used anymore.

lvo-plugin.xml:: Contains configuration for the latest version plugin. This XML file contains the location of the
properties file that the repository manager queries to check for a newer version.

nexus.xml:: The bulk of the configuration is contained in this file. This file maintains a list of repositories
and all server-wide configuration like the SMTP settings, security realms, repository groups, targets, path
mappings and others.

pgp.xml:: Contains PGP key server configuration.

nexus-obr-plugin.properties:: Contains configuration for the Nexus OSGi Bundle repository plugin in {pro}.

procurement.xml:: Contains configuration for the procurement plugin in {pro}.

security-configuration.xml:: Contains global security configuration. 

security.xml:: Contains security configuration about users and roles.

staging.xml:: Contains configuration for the Nexus Staging Plugin in {pro}.

[[nexus-home-conf]]
==== Configuration Directory

After installing the repository manager and creating the +nexus+ symlink as described earlier, your fnexus folder
contains another conf directory. This directory contains configuration for the Jetty servlet container. You will
only need to modify the files in this directory if you are customizing the configuration of Jetty servlet
container or the behavior of the scripts that start the repository manager.

The files and folders contained in this directory are:

nexus.properties:: This file contains configuration variables which control the behavior of the repository manager
and the Jetty servlet container. If you are customizing the port and host that the repository manager listens to,
you change the +application-port+ and +application-host+ properties defined in this file. If you want to customize
the location of the +sonatype-work+ directory, you modify the value of the +nexus-work+ property in this
configuration file. Changing +nexus-webapp-context-path+ allows you to configure the server context path the
repository manager will be available at.

[[jetty-xml]]
jetty.xml and jetty-*.xml:: Configuration files for the Eclipse Jetty servlet container running the repository
manager. Jetty users are used to providing a list of jetty XML config files which are merged to form the final
configuration. As an advanced configuration option, the repository manager supports this merging concept in its
launcher code as of version 2.8.
+
You can specify additional jetty XML
configuration files to load to form the final configuration.  For the
standard distribution bundle, these files can be specified using
special properties located in +NEXUS_HOME/bin/jsw/conf/wrapper.conf+.
+
----
wrapper.app.parameter.1=./conf/jetty.xml
wrapper.app.parameter.2=./conf/jetty-requestlog.xml 
# add more indexed app parameters...  
----
+
Any of the files located at +NEXUS_HOME/conf/jetty-*.xml+ can be
specified as part of the +wrapper.app.parameter.n+ property, where n
is the next highest number not already used. The
http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.com/doc/english/prop-app-parameter-n.html[Java
Service Wrapper] 
documentation contains more information about this
property. This setup allows for a simple method to add configuration for
https, JMX and others by adjusting a few properties.


WARNING: Versions of {pro} and {oss} prior to 2.8 loaded all of the Jetty configuration from one jetty.xml file,
typically found at +NEXUS_HOME/conf/jetty.xml+ and required modifications to this file for configuration
changes. Examples were available in +NEXUS_HOME/conf/examples+. These files cannot be used in version 2.8 or higher,
as they were intended to be standalone files that could not be merged into other files.

[[monitoring]]
=== Monitoring 

{inall}

Now that your repository manager instance is up and running, you need to ensure that it stays that way. Typically
this is done on a number of levels and each organization and system administration team has its own preferences
and tools.

In general you can monitor:

* hardware values like CPU, memory or diskspace utilization and many more
* operating system level values like processes running
* Java Virtual Machine specific values
* application specific value

For the hardware and operating system values, a large number of
dedicated tools exist. Many of these tools can be configured to work
with application-specific logs and other events. The following section
discusses some of the available information in the repositiory manager. It can
potentially be integrated into the usage of the more generic tools for
monitoring, log capturing and analysis.

A host of information from the operating system, the Java Virtual Machine and the application itself is available
via the <<support-tools, Support Tools>>, which allow you to inspect the value directly in the user interface.

[[general-logging]]
==== General Logging 

The repository manager logs events in the +sonatype-work/nexus/logs/nexus.log+ file. In addition a dedicated user
interface to configure and inspect the log is available. Further information about this interface can be found in
<<logging>>.


[[request-access-logging]]
==== Request Access Logging

Logging all access requests to the repository manager allows you to gain a good understanding of the usage in your
organization and the sources of these requests.

For example, you will be able to tell if the main load is due to a CI server cluster or from your developers,
based on the IP numbers of the requests. You can also see the spread or requests and load across different time
zones. Also available for review are the URLs , API calls, and features that are used in the repository manager.

Requests access logging is enabled by default in version 2.8 or higher and uses a performant and flexible LogBack
implementation with built-in log rotation already configured for 90 days of log file retention. The log is written
to the file +sonatype-work/nexus/logs/request.log+ and contains all requests and the username for authenticated
requests.

The configuration is located in +NEXUS_HOME/conf/logback-access.xml+ and can be changed to suit your
requirements. If you change the file, a restart of the repository manager is required for these changes to take
effect.

If you do not want to run access logging, you can disable it by
commenting out the line 

----
wrapper.app.parameter.2=conf/jetty-requestlog.xml 
----

in +bin/jsw/conf/wrapper.conf+.

WARNING: Older versions of {pro} and {oss} require different customization of the Jetty configuration
files. Instructions for these customizations can be found on the
https://support.sonatype.com/entries/21902551[support site].

[[jmx]]
==== Using Java Management Extension JMX

JMX is a common tool for managing and monitoring Java applications
with client software like the free http://visualvm.java.net/[VisualVM]
and many others available. It can be performed locally on the server
as well as remotely.

The repository manager can be configured to support JMX by adding

----
wrapper.app.parameter.3=./conf/jetty-jmx.xml
----

to the list of +wrapper.app+ parameters in
+NEXUS_HOME/bin/jsw/conf/wrapper.conf+ and set the parameters
+jmx-host+ and +jmx-port+ in +NEXUS_HOME/conf/nexus.properties+.

----
jmx-host=192.168.10.12
jmx-port=1099
----

+jmx-host+ is the host name, or commonly the IP address, to remotely monitor the application using JMX from
another host and +jmx-port+ is the network port used for the connection. It is important to ensure that the port
is not blocked by any network setup, when connecting remotely. The value of 1099 is the default port used for JMX,
but any other available port can be used as well.

WARNING: Versions older than 2.8 require different procedures, depending on the specific version.

Once the repository manager is restarted with JMX enabled you can inspect the running JVM in
detail. <<monitoring-jmx-visualvm-overview>> and <<monitoring-jmx-visualvm-charts>> show some example screenshots
of VisualVM connected to a repository manager instance running on localhost.

[[monitoring-jmx-visualvm-overview]]

[[monitoring-jmx-visualvm-charts]]
.CPU, Memory and Other Visualizations of {pro} Monitored via JMX in VisualVM
image::figs/web/monitoring-jmx-visualvm-charts.png[scale=50]

Depending on the tool used to connect, a number of monitoring, analysis
and troubleshooting actions can be performed. Please refer to the
documentation about your specific tool for more information.

[[analytics]]
==== Analytics

The analytics integration of {pro} allows you to gather a good understanding of your usage, since it enables the
collection of event data in the repository manager. It collects non-sensitive information about how you are using
the repository manager. It is useful to you from a compatibility perspective, since it gathers answers to
questions such as what features are most important, where are users having difficulties, and what
integrations/APIs are actively in use.

The collected information is limited to the use of the user interface and the REST API, the primary interaction
points between your environment and the repository manager. Only the user interface navigation flows and REST
endpoints being called are recorded. None of the request specific data (e.g., credentials or otherwise sensitive
information) is ever captured.

You can enable the event logging in the 'Settings' section of the
'Analytics' tab available via 'Analytics' menu item in the
'Administration' menu in the left side navigation. Select the
checkbox beside 'Enable analytics event collection' and press the
'Save' button.

You can choose to provide this data automatically to Sonatype by
selecting the checkbox beside 'Enable automatic analytics event
submission'. It enables Sonatype to tailor the ongoing development of
the product. Alternatively, you can submit the data manually or just
use the gathered data for your own analysis only.

Once enabled all events logged can be inspected in the 'Events' tab in
the 'Analytics' section displayed in <<fig-analytics-events>>.

[[fig-analytics-events]]
.List of Events in the Analytics Tab
image::figs/web/analytics-events.png[scale=50]

The list of events shows the 'Type' and the 'Timestamp' of the event as well as the 'User' that triggered it and
any 'Attributes'. Each row has a '+' symbol in the first column that allows you to expand the row vertically. Each
attribute will be expanded into a separate line allowing you to inspect all the information that is potentially
submitted to Sonatype. The 'User' value is replaced by a salted hash so that no username information is
transmitted. The 'Anonymization Salt' is automatically randomly generated by the repository manager and can
optionally be configured in the 'Analytics: Collection' capability manually. This administration area can
additionally be used to change the random identifier for the repository manager instance.

TIP: More information about capabilities can be found in <<capabilities>>.

If you desire to further inspect the data that is potentially
submitted, you can select to download the file containing the JSON
files in a zip archive by clicking the 'Export' button above the events list
and downloading the file. The 'Submit' button can be used to manually
submit the events to Sonatype.

When you select to automatically submit the analytics data, a
scheduled task, named 'Automatically submit analytics events', is
automatically created. This task is preconfigured to run at 1:00 AM
every day. If desired the recurrence can be changed in the scheduled
tasks administration area documented in <<scheduled-tasks>>.

IMPORTANT: Sonatype values your input greatly and hopes you will
activate the analytics feature and the automatic submission to allow
us to ensure ongoing development is well aligned with your needs. In
addition, we appreciate any further direct contact and feedback in
person and look forward to hearing from you.
