== Prerequisites and Preparation

{inall}

The following guide for evaluating {pro} is based on an assumption of installing the repository manager itself as
well as the various technologies used in the specific evaluation example all on one computer. A more extended
evaluation of {pro} in a team environment should follow the instructions for a full installation as documented in
the book http://links.sonatype.com/products/nexus/pro/docs[Repository Management with Nexus]. Consult the book for
further in-depth documentation about all features of the {pro}.

Besides the installation of the repository manager itself, various evaluations will need different prerequisites
installed on the machine you use for your evaluation. The installation instructions of these technologies follow
below. Only follow the instructions referenced from the examples in which you are interested. For example you will
only need to install Visual Studio and NuGet if you want to evaluate the .Net Integration of {pro}.

=== A Note about the Operating System

Some of the tasks described are referencing command line calls. Where
that is the case, this guide will use Unix typical commands and syntax
as used on a bash shell. This is the most common environment on Linux
and Mac OSX computers. On Windows machines, a bash shell can be
installed as well, using the cygwin system. However the typical
usage would be to use the Windows command prompt with slightly different
calls. <<tbl-command-line>> displays a number of examples for typical
tasks carried out in the evaluations with their bash as well as
Windows shell commands.

[[tbl-command-line]]
.Commandline Invocation Examples
[options="header"]
|======================
|Task | Bash Shell | Window Shell 
| Delete a file          | +rm filename+                 | +del filename+
| Delete a directory | +rm -rf directoryname+  | +rmdir directoryname+
| Delete a directory in users home directory | +rm -rf
  ~/.m2/repository+  | +rmdir /S %HOMEPATH%\.m2\repository+
| Change to the users home directory | +cd ~+ | +cd %HOMEPATH%+
| Script invocation | +./build+ | +build.bat+
| Gradle Wrapper script invocation | +./gradlew+ | +gradlew.bat+
|======================

=== Java Runtime

{pro} itself as well as some of the technologies used in the evaluation require a Java runtime or development kit,
which is available for most operating systems. We recommend to install the latest Oracle Java 8 JDK available from
the http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[download web page] and following the
installation instructions on the same site.

After a successful installation, you can verify it by running the command +java -version+, which should result in
an output similar to

----
java version "1.7.0_75"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_75-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.75-b04, mixed mode)
----

WARNING: {pro} and {oss} require Java 7 or Java 8.

[[eval-prereq-maven]]
=== Apache Maven

Apache Maven can be retrieved from the
 http://maven.apache.org/download.html[download page] and installed
following the instructions available there. We recommend the usage of
the latest available Maven 3 version. 

After a successful installation you can verify it with running the
command +mvn --version+, which should result in an output similar to

----
Apache Maven 3.3.3 (799...; 2015-04-22T04:57:37-07:00)
Maven home: /opt/tools/apache-maven-3.3.3
Java version: 1.7.0_75, vendor: Oracle Corporation
Java home: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_75.jdk/Contents/Home/jre
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "mac os x", version: "10.8.5", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"
----

[[eval-prereq-gradle]]
=== Gradle

The examples in this guide use the so-called Gradle wrapper script. It
allows you to get Gradle installed automatically by the wrapper and
invoke all Gradle commands via it. To use it you simple invoke all
gradle commands with +./gradlew+ on Unix based systems and
+gradlew.bat+ on Windows instead of +gradle+.

Alternatively Gradle can be retrieved from the
http://www.gradle.org/downloads[download page] and installed following
the instructions available in the
http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/installation.html[User
Guide]. We recommend the usage of the latest available Gradle version.

After a successful installation, you can verify it with running the
command +gradle -v+, which should result in an output similar to

----
Gradle 2.0

Build time:   2014-07-01 07:45:34 UTC
Build number: none

OS:           Mac OS X 10.8.5 x86_64
----

[[eval-prereq-antivy]]
=== Apache Ant and Apache Ivy

Apache Ant can be retrieved from the
http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi[download page] and installed
following the instructions available in the
http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html[manual]. We recommend the
usage of the latest available Ant version.

After a successful completion,f you can verify your Ant installation
by running the command +ant -version+, which should result in an
output similar to

----
Apache Ant(TM) version 1.9.4 compiled on April 29 2014
----

The example projects used in this guide contain ant targets in their build files
that will automatically install Apache Ivy as part of the
build. Alternatively you can retrieve Apache Ivy from the
http://ant.apache.org/ivy/download.cgi[download page] and install it following the
http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/latest-milestone/install.html[instructions].

[[eval-prereq-nuget]]
=== Microsoft Visual Studio and NuGet

Microsoft Visual Studio and NuGet are needed to evaluate the .Net
support of {pro}. There are a number of different Visual
Studio distributions.  Some of these distributions may have NuGet
already installed, while others do not.  Even if your Visual Studio
installation is bundled with NuGet, you will want to make sure that
you have upgraded to the latest version of the tool.

http://www.nuget.org/[NuGet] is a fast-paced project, and you'll find that
new packages available on NuGet Gallery may not be compatible with
older versions of the NuGet package manager.

For detailed instructions on installing NuGet in Visual Studio, please
go to the http://docs.nuget.org/[NuGet project's documentation site]
and refer to the
http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/installing-nuget[Installing
NuGet] instructions.

[[eval-getting-started]]
== Getting Started

This guide is based on the usage of {pro}. A lot of the
core features are available in {oss} as well and some
examples are suitable to assess the open source version as well.

* *Step 1:*
   http://links.sonatype.com/products/nexus/pro/trial[Download
   the {pro} Trial Installer] for your operating system.

* *Step 2:* Run the {pro} Trial Installer.

* *Step 3:* Start the {pro} from the {pro} Trial Installer.

When the repository manager has started just click the URL in the wizard or go to
http://localhost:8081/nexus[http://localhost:8081/nexus] in a browser window.

NOTE: This guide and the examples reference the  URL
http://localhost:8081/nexus. If you have chosen to use a different
port during the installation of the trial simply change the URLs.

Below are several directories to know:

Installation Directory: This is where the application files are installed on your system. We refer to this as
*<nexus_install>*.

Work Directory: This directory contains your specific repository manager instance configuration files. We refer to
this as *<nexus_work>*.

Eval Guide Directory: This directory contains supporting sample project
files and this document. We refer to this as *<nexus_eval>*.

NOTE: You can locate these directories by viewing the Control Panel.

In case something goes wrong and the repository manager seems to be unavailable, you can examine the following two
log files to diagnose problems.

----
<nexus_work>/logs/nexus-launcher.log
<nexus_work>/logs/nexus.log
----

The repository manager tries to listen on port 8081. If you have another application listening on this port, the
repository manager will not be able to start. You can change the port the repository manager listens on. Open this
file

----
<nexus_install>/conf/nexus.properties 
----

Edit the line that looks like this:

----
application-port=8081
----

For example, to access the repository manager on port 9090 instead, change the line to

----
application-port=9090
----

Save the file and restart the repository manager.

=== Activating Your {pro} Trial

Once the repository manager is started and you are accessing the user interface the first time, you will see the
trial activation form. Provide your full name, email address, organization, and location and click on 'Submit
Activation Request'.

You will immediately receive an email from Sonatype with the subject
“Your {pro} Trial License,” which contains your trial
license key. Paste this license key into the license field in the
{pro} user interface. Click 'Activate' to activate your
14-day {pro} trial. Once your trial is activated, you will
be presented with the user interface.

=== Logging in as an Administrator

After activating your repository manager install, you can log into the user interface as an administrator. Go to
http://localhost:8081/nexus/ and click on the Login button in the upper right-hand corner of the interface.

.{pro} User Interface with Login 
image::figs/web/eval-login.png[scale=40]

The default administrator username is +admin+ and password is
+admin123+.

The {pro} Trial evaluation guide assumes that you are
logged in as an administrator.

=== Getting Started with Your {pro} Evaluation

To make it easier to evaluate {pro}, we’ve created a set of projects to demonstrate the features of {oss} and
{pro}.  These example projects are bundled with the trial installer for your convenience.

In addition, they are available as the nexus-book-examples project on
GitHub at https://github.com/sonatype/nexus-book-examples for you to
download and inspect separately, if desired. The latest version of all
the examples is available as a zip archive at
https://github.com/sonatype/nexus-book-examples/archive/master.zip.

When you downloaded the trial distribution of {pro}, your server is also preconfigured to demonstrate important
features.

The trial distribution contains the following customizations:

* {pro} has been preconfigured to download the search index from the Central Repository.

* A Staging profile has been configured to demonstrate release management.

* {pro} proxies NuGet Gallery so that you can quickly evaluate support for .NET development.

[[eval-proxy-publish]]
== The Basics: Proxying and Publishing

{inall}

[quote, Build Engineer, Financial Industry]
____
After a few weeks the importance of having a repository manager is so
obvious no one on my team can believe we used to develop software
without one.
____

If you are new to repository management, the first step is to evaluate
the two basic benefits of running a repository manager: proxying and
publishing. 

You can reap these benefits with any Java/JVM build system that
includes declarative dependency management and understands the Maven
repository format. In the following we are going to cover the details
for Apache Maven, Gradle and Apache Ant/Apache Ivy based builds. Build
tools like SBT, Leiningen, Gant/Grails and others can be configured to
do the same and get access to the same benefits.



[[eval-proxy]]
=== Proxying Components

If you use a dependency in your software, your build downloads components from a remote repository, such as the
http://search.maven.org[Central Repository] and others. Your systems depend on these components. If one of these
critical remote repositories becomes unavailable, your productivity can grind to a halt.

This is where {pro} can help. {pro} is preconfigured to proxy the Central Repository, and other remote
repositories can be easily added. Once set up, the repository manager maintains a local cache of the needed
components from the remote repositories for you. Your build is more reliable when all the components you require
are cached by the repository manager. It is providing you with dramatic efficiency and speed improvements across
your entire development effort.

*In this example, you will...*

* Configure your build to download components from the repository manager.

* Pre-cache dependencies and build components with an initial build.

* Note organization-wide improvements in build reliability.

*Let's get started using the provided scripts:*

The eval bundle includes an installation of Apache Maven as well
scripts that isolate your evaluation from the rest of your system and
make it extremely easy for you to follow. The Gradle examples use a
wrapper script to allow you to simply follow the example. To follow
the Ant/Ivy examples you will have to install Apache Ant as explained
in <<eval-prereq-antivy>>.

. Go to the evaluation guide directory you configured during the
  {pro} install, which is named evalguide by default and
  can be found in your users home directory, and run the command:
+
----
$ cd maven
$ ./build -f simple-project/pom.xml clean install
----
+
To use Apache Maven or if you want to try Gradle use
+
---- 
$ cd gradle/simple-project
$ ./gradlew build
----
+ 
With Apache Ant and Ivy you can run
+
----
$ cd ant-ivy/simple-project
$ ant jar
----


. As the project builds, you will notice that all components are downloaded from your local repository manager
instance installed with requests from Apache Maven:
+
----
Downloading: http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/groups/public/org
  /apache/maven/plugins/maven-clean-plugin/2.5/maven-clean-plugin-2.5.pom
Downloaded: http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/groups/public/org
  /apache/maven/plugins/maven-clean-plugin/2.5/maven-clean-plugin-2.5.pom 
  (4 KB at 1.3 KB/sec)
...
----
+ 
Here are examples from Gradle:
+
----
Download http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/groups/public/org/
  codehaus/jackson/jackson-core-asl/1.8.0/jackson-core-asl-1.8.0.jar

  codehaus/jackson/jackson-mapper-asl/1.8.0/jackson-mapper-asl-1.8.0.jar
Download http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/groups/public/com/
  google/sitebricks/sitebricks-converter/0.8.5/sitebricks-converter-0.8.5.jar
...
----
+
Here are examples from Apache Ivy:
+
----
[ivy:retrieve] downloading http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/
  groups/public/asm/asm-commons/3.2/asm-commons-3.2.jar ...
[ivy:retrieve] .. (32kB)
[ivy:retrieve] .. (0kB)
[ivy:retrieve] 	[SUCCESSFUL ] asm#asm-commons;3.2!asm-commons.jar (313ms)
...
----



. After the build has successfully completed, delete the local Maven
  repository cache in the eval guide directory and rerun the build as before
+
----
$ cd maven
$ rm -rf repository
----
+ 
Delete the Gradle cache with 
+
----
$ rm -rf ~/.gradle
----
+
Delete the Ivy cache with
+
----
$ ant clean-cache clean
----

. Notice how the downloads are occurring much faster. The components are no longer retrieved from the remote
  repositories before being served by the repository manager, but they are supplied straight from the proxy
  repository cache.

. To verify that components are being cached in the repository manager, open the Repositories panel by clicking on
  'Repositories' in the left-hand main menu. Once the list of repositories is displayed, select Central. Click on
  the 'Browse Storage' tab and observe the tree of components downloaded and successfully cached in the repository
  manager.

*Alternatively using your own Apache Maven setup:*

. Ensure that Apache Maven is installed as a prerequisite as documented in <<eval-prereq-maven>>.

. Go to the evaluation guide directory you configured during the {pro} install and configure Maven to access the
  repository manager with the provided 'settings.xml'. Ensure to back up any existing settings file and adapt the
  port in the mirror url, if you have chosen to use a different port than 8081 in the trial installer.
+
----
$ cp maven/settings/settings.xml ~/.m2/
----

. Optionally, if you do not want to use the default local repository location of Maven in `~/.m2/repository`,
  change the localRepository settings in the settings.xml file to an absolute path.

.  Build the simple-project, and observe the downloads from the repository manager.
+
----
$ cd maven/simple-project/
$ mvn clean install
----

. After the build has successfully completed, delete the local Maven repository cache and rerun the build. Notice
  the improved build performance and the cached components in the repository manager.
+
----
$ rm -rf ~/.m2/repository
----


.Conclusion
****
Your builds will be faster and more reliable now that you are caching components in {pro} and retrieving them from
there. Once {pro} has cached a component locally, there is no need to make another roundtrip to the remote
repository server. The caching benefits all tools configured to access the repository manager.
****

=== Publishing Components

{pro} makes it easier to share components internally. How do you distribute and deploy your own applications?
Without a repository manager, internal code is often distributed and deployed using an SCM, a shared file system,
or some other inefficient method for sharing binary components.

With {pro} you create hosted repositories, giving you a place to upload your own component. You can then feed your
components back into the same repositories referenced by all developers in your organization.

*In this example, you will...*

* Publish a component to {pro}.

* Watch another project download this component as a dependency from the repository manager.

*Let's get started using the provided scripts:*

. Follow the proxying evaluation example from <<eval-proxy>>.

. Go to the evaluation guide directory and publish the
simple-project to the repository manager with the Maven wrapper script.
+
----
$ cd maven
$ ./build -f simple-project/pom.xml clean deploy
----
+
With your own Maven installation you can use 
+
----
$ cd maven/simple-project/
$ mvn clean deploy
----
+ 
To deploy the project with Gradle, you can run the commands 
+
----
$ cd gradle/simple-project
$ ./gradlew upload
----
+ 
The equivalent Ant invocation is
+
----
$ cd ant-ivy/simple-project
$ ant deploy
----


. The simple-project has been preconfigured to publish its build output in the form of a JAR component to your
  local instance of {pro}.

. Observe how the build tools log the deployment to the repository manager, e.g., Maven

. To verify that the simple-project component was deployed to repository manager, click on Repositories and then
  select the Snapshots repository. Select the +Browse Storage+ tab as shown in this illustration.
+
.Successfully Deployed Components in the Snapshots Repository
image::figs/web/eval-publish.png[scale=50]


. Once this component has been published, return to the evaluation
  sample projects directory and run a build of another-project:
+
----
$ cd maven
$ build -f another-project/pom.xml clean install
----
+
With your own Maven installation you can use 
+
----
$ cd maven/another-project
$ mvn clean install
----
+ 
To build the second project with Gradle, simply use
+
----
$ cd gradle/another-project
$ ./gradlew build
----
+
Perform the same action with Ant using
+
----
$ cd ant-ivy/another-project
$ ant jar
----



. This second project has a dependency on the first
  project declared in the Maven pom.xml with
+
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.sonatype.nexus.examples</groupId>
  <artifactId>simple-project</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----
+
and in the Gradle build.gradle file as 
+
----
dependencies {
    compile "org.sonatype.nexus.examples:simple-project:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
} 
----
+
Ivy declares the dependency in ivy.xml and it looks like this
+
----
<dependencies>
  <dependency org="org.sonatype.nexus.examples" name="simple-project"
      rev="1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"/>
</dependencies>
----
+
During the build, it is relying on the repository manager when it attempts to retrieve the component from
  simple-project.

Now that you are sharing components of your projects internally, you
do not need to build each other's software projects anymore. You can
focus on writing the code for your own components and the integration
of all components to create a larger software component. In fact, it
does not even matter which build tool created the component, since
the Maven repository format is understood by all of them.

.Conclusion
**** 
{oss} and {pro} can serve as an important tool for collaboration
between different developers and different development groups. It removes the
need to store binaries in source control or shared filesystems and makes
collaboration more efficient.

=== Identify Insecure OSS Components In {pro}

The Repository Health Check in {pro} turns your
repository manager into the first line of defence against security
vulnerabilities. {pro} scans components and finds cached
components with known vulnerabilities from the Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures (CVE) database. You can get an immediate view of your
exposure from the Repository Health Check summary report with
vulnerabilities grouped by severity according to the Common Vulnerability
Scoring System (CVSS).

As your developers download components, they may be unwittingly downloading components with critical security
vulnerabilities that might expose your applications to known exploits. According to a joint study by Aspect
Security and Sonatype released in 2012, Global 500 corporations downloaded 2.8 million flawed components in one
year. The repository manager becomes an effective way to discover flawed components in your repositories allowing
you to avoid falling victim to known exploits.

.Repository Heath Check Summary
image::figs/web/eval-rhc-overview.png[scale=50]

*In this example, you will...*

* Start an analysis of all components proxied from the Central
  Repository.

* Inspect the number of security vulnerabilities found.

*Let's get started*

. Follow the proxying examples in <<eval-proxy-publish>> to seed the Central proxy repository of your repository
  manager instance. These examples include several components with security vulnerabilities and license issues as
  dependencies.

. Once your repository manager instance has cached the components, open the user interface, log in as
administrator and click on the green Analyze button next to your Central proxy repository.

. After the completion of the analysis, the button will change into an
  indicator of the number of security and license issues found.

. Hover your mouse over the indicator and the repository manager will show you a summary report detailing the
number and type of security vulnerabilities present in you repository.

. Optionally, build some of your own applications to get further
  components proxied and see if additional security issues appear.


.Security Vulnerability Summary Display from Repository Health Check
image::figs/web/eval-security.png[scale=60]

{pro} users gain access to further details about all the
components with security vulnerabilities, including their repository
coordinates to uniquely identify the component as well as links to the
vulnerability database records for further details.

.Conclusion
****
The Repository Heath Check of {pro} allows you to get an understanding
 of all the security vulnerabilities affecting the components you have
 proxied into your environment and which might potentially be part of
 the software you are creating, distributing, and deploying in
 production environments.
****

=== Track Your Exposure To OSS Licenses

With Open Source Software (OSS) component usage as the de facto
standard for enterprise application development, the importance of
tracking and identifying your exposure to OSS licenses is an essential
part of the software development life cycle. Organizations need tools
that let them govern, track, and manage the adoption of open source
projects and the evaluation of the licenses and obligations that are
part of OSS development and OSS component usage.

With {pro}’s Repository Health Check, your repository
becomes more than just a place to store binary components. It becomes
a tool to implement policies and govern the open source licenses used
in development to create your applications.


*In this example, you will...*

* Start an analysis of all components proxied from the Central.
  Repository

* Inspect the number of license issues found.

*Let's get started*

. Follow the proxying examples in <<eval-proxy-publish>> to seed the Central proxy repository of your {pro}
  instance. These examples include several components with security vulnerabilities and license issues as
  dependencies.

. Once your repository manager instance has cached the components, log in to the user interface as administrator
and click on the green 'Analyze' button next to your 'Central' proxy repository in the 'Repositories' list.

. After the completion of the analysis, the button will change into an
  indicator of the number of security and license issues found.

. Hover your mouse over the indicator and the repository manager will show you a summary report detailing the
number and type of license issues of components present in you repository.

. Optionally, build some of your own applications to get further
  components proxied and see if additional license issues appear.

.License Analysis Summary Display from Repository Health Check 
image::figs/web/eval-license.png[scale=50]

{oss} and the trial version show the summary information
found by the analysis.

{pro} customers can access a detailed report to identify
specific components with known security vulnerabilities or
unacceptable licenses. The component lists can be sorted by OSS
license or security vulnerabilities, and {pro} provides
specific information about licenses and security vulnerabilities. A
detailed walkthrough of this report is available on the
http://www.sonatype.com/Products/Nexus-Professional/Features/Repository-Health-Check[Sonatype
website].

.Repository Health Check Details with License Issues List
image::figs/web/eval-rhc-detail.png[scale=50]


.Conclusion
****
OSS License compliance and security assessments are not something you
 do when you have the time. It is something that should be a part of
 your everyday development cycle, as it is with {pro}’s Repository
 Health Check.
****
== Process Improvements

=== Grouping Repositories

{inall}

Once you have established {pro} and set up your build, provisioning system, and other tools to connect to the
repository manager, you can take advantage of repository groups. The best practice to expose {pro} is to get users
to connect to the Public Repositories group as configured in the settings.xml as documented in <<eval-proxy>>.

When all clients are connecting to the repository manager via a group, you can easily provide additional
repository content to all users by adding new repositories to the group.

For example, imagine a group in your organization is starting to use components provided by the JBoss release
repository available at https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases/. The developers are
already accessing the repository manager via the public group. All you have to do is to create a new proxy
repository for the JBoss release repository and add it to the public group and all developers, continuous
integration (CI) servers and other tools will have access to the additional components.

To add the Grails repositories, proxy them and add them to the group. 
The same approach applies to proxy https://clojars.org/[Clojars] or 
other repository of a business partner or suppier who is protected
 by user credentials.

Another advantage of groups is that you can mix release and snapshot
repositories and easily expose all the components via one easy access
point.

Besides using the default public group, you can create additional
groups that expose other contexts. An example would be to create a
group for all staged releases allowing a limited number of users
access to your release components as part of the release process.


.Conclusion
**** 
Using groups allows you to expose multiple repositories, mix snapshot
and release components and easily administrate it all on the {pro}
server. This allows you to provide further components to your
developers or other users, without requiring a change on these client
system, tremendously simplifying the administration effort.
****

=== Staging a Release with {pro}

{inrmonly}

When was the last time you did a software release to a production
system? Did it involve a QA sign-off? What was the process you used to
redeploy, if QA found a problem at the last minute? Developers often
find themselves limited by the amount of time it takes to respond and
create incremental builds during a release.

The Nexus Staging Suite changes this by providing workflow support for
binary software components. If you need to create a release component
and deploy it to a hosted repository, you can use the Staging Suite to
post a release, which can be tested, promoted, or discarded, before it
is committed to a release repository.

The following example uses Apache Maven. Example projects for Gradle 
and Ant are part of the eval guide resources.

*In this example, you will...*

* Configure a project to publish its build output component to {pro}.

* Deploy a release and view the deployed component in a temporary
  staging repository.

* Promote or discard the contents of this temporary staging repository.

*Let's get started using the provided scripts:*

. This example assumes that you have successfully deployed the
  simple-project as documented in <<eval-proxy>>. 

. Inspect the preconfigured 'Example Release Profile' staging profile
by selecting it from the list available after selecting 'Staging
Profiles' in the 'Build Promotion' menu in the left-hand
navigation.

. Notice that the version of the simple-project in the pom.xml ends
with -SNAPSHOT. This means that it is in development.

. Change the version of the simple project to release version by
removing the -SNAPSHOT in a text editor or run the command
+
----
$ ./build -f simple-project/pom.xml versions:set -DnewVersion=1.0.0
----

. Publish the release to the Staging suite with
+
----
$ ./build -f simple-project/pom.xml clean deploy
----

. To view the staging repository, click on 'Staging Repositories' in
  the 'Build Promotion' menu and you should see a single staging
  repository as shown in this illustration.

. Click on 'Close' to close the repository and make it available via
  the public group.

. Experiment with Staging, at this point you can:

.. Click on 'Drop' to discard the contents of the repository and be able to 
   stage another release.

.. Click on 'Release' to publish the contents of the repository to the
   release repository.

. Once you release the staging repository, you will be able to find
the release components in the 'Releases' hosted repository.

$ cd maven/simple-project
$ mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=1.0.0
----

. And publishing to the Staging suite with 
+
----
$ mvn clean deploy
----

.Conclusion
**** 
Staging gives you a standard interface for controlling and managing
 releases. A collection of related release components can be staged for
 qualification and testing as a single atomic unit. These staged
 release repositories can be discarded or released pending testing and
 evaluation.

=== Hosting Project Web Sites

{inall}

{pro} and {oss} can be used as a publishing destination for project websites. You don’t have to worry about
configuring another web server or configuring your builds to distribute the project site using a different
protocol. Simply point your Maven project at the repository manager and deploy the project site.

With the repository manager as a project’s site hosting solution, there’s no need to ask IT to provision extra web
servers just to host project documentation. Keep your development infrastructure consolidated and deploy project
sites to the same server that serves your project’s components.

You can use this feature internally, but it is even better suited if
you are providing an API or components for integration. You can host
full project websites with JavaDoc and any other desired
documentation right with the components you provide to your partners
and customers.

*In this example, you will...*

* Create a Hosted repository with the Maven Site provider.

* Configure your project to publish a website to {pro}.

*Let's get started using the provided scripts:*

. Create a hosted repository with the 'Site' format and a 'Repository
ID' called 'site' ->
http://www.sonatype.com/books/nexus-book/reference/_creating_a_site_repository.html[Read
more...]

. Deploy the simple-project component and site to the repository manager:
+
----
$ ./build -f simple-project/pom.xml clean deploy site-deploy
----

. Browse the generate site on the repository manager at http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/sites/site/


. Optionally, configure your own Maven project to deploy a site to the repository manager ->
http://www.sonatype.com/books/nexus-book/reference/_configuring_maven_for_site_deployment.html[Read more...]

. Publish it to the repository manager -> http://www.sonatype.com/books/nexus-book/reference/_publishing_a_maven_site_to_nexus.html[Read more...]

*Alternatively using your own Apache Maven setup:*

. Follow the steps described above with the modification of deploying
the site with 
+
----
$ cd maven/simple-project
$ mvn clean deploy site-deploy
----


.Conclusion
****
If your projects need to publish HTML reports or a project web site, {pro} and {oss} provide a consolidated target
 for publishing project-related content.

=== Process and Security Improvements with Maven Settings Management and User Token

{inrmonly}

The Maven +settings.xml+ file plays a key role for retrieving as well as deploying components to the repository
manager. It contains `<server>` sections that typically contain the username and password for accessing a
repository manager in clear text. Especially with single sign-on (SSO) solutions used for authentication, this is
not desirable. In addition, security policies often mean that the file regularly needs to be updated.

The User Token feature of {pro} allows you to replace the SSO username and password with {pro}-specific tokens
that are autogenerated and managed by the repository manager.

Furthermore, the Nexus Maven Settings Management allows you to manage Maven Settings. Once you have developed a
Maven Settings template, developers can connect to {pro} using the Nexus M2Settings Maven plugin that will take
responsibility for downloading a Maven Settings file from the repository manager and replacing the existing Maven
Settings on a local workstation. It can be configured to automatically place your user tokens in the settings.xml
file.

*In this example, you will...*

* Explore the configuration of a Maven Settings template in {pro}.

* Activate and access your user token.

*Let's get started*

. Log into the repository manager as administor and access the 'Maven Settings' administration via the item in the
  'Enterprise' menu.

. Press the 'Add' button, provide a name and edit the new settings file.

. Add the server section:
+
----
<servers>
    <server>
      <id>nexus</id>
      <!-- User-token: $[userToken] -->
      <username>$[userToken.nameCode]</username>
      <password>$[userToken.passCode]</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
----

. Read more about potential configuration and usage in 
http://www.sonatype.com/books/nexus-book/reference/settings-sect-install.html[Manage Maven Settings Templates]

. Downloading the settings template requires {pro} running via HTTPS and can then be performed with the command
below and following the prompts:
+
----
mvn org.sonatype.plugins:nexus-m2settings-maven-plugin:1.6.2:download -Dsecure=false
----
+ 


. Note that the 'secure' option is set to 'false' for your evaluation. The plugin would otherwise abort for using
the insecure HTTP protocol once you provide your evaluation {pro} URL of +http://localhost:8081/nexus+. For a
production usage, we recommend using the secure HTTPS protocol for your {pro} deployments.

. Find out more about the usage in Download Settings from the repository manager ->
http://www.sonatype.com/books/nexus-book/reference/settings-sect-downloading.html[Read
more...]

. Activate User Token in the configuration in the 'Security' menu 'User
Token' administration by checking the 'Enabled' box and pressing the 'Save'
button.

. Access your 'User Profile' in the drop-down of your user name in the
top right-hand corner of the user interface.

. Use the drop-down in the 'Profile' panel to access 'User Token'.

. In the 'User Token' screen, press 'Access User Token', provide your
username and password again, and inspect the tokens in the pop-up dialog.

.Conclusion
****
The distribution of +settings.xml+ is a crucial part of the rollout of repository manager usage. With the help of
the Nexus M2Settings Maven Plugin and the server side settings template, it is possible to automate initial
distribution as well as updates to the used +settings.xml+ files. The User Token feature allows you to avoid
having SSO credentials exposed in your file system at all.

[[eval-nuget-proxy]]
== .NET Integration 

{inall}

=== Consume .NET Components from NuGet Gallery

The NuGet project provides a package and dependency management solution for .NET developers. It is integrated
directly into Visual Studio and makes it easy to add, remove and update libraries and tools in Visual Studio and
on the command line for projects that use the .NET Framework. {pro} can act as a proxy between your developer’s
Visual Studio instances and the public NuGet Gallery.

When you configure {pro} to act as a proxy for NuGet
Gallery you gain a more reliable build that depends on locally cached
copies of the components on which you depend. If NuGet Gallery has
availability problems, your developers can continue to be
productive. Caching components locally will also result in a faster
response for developers downloading .NET dependencies.

*In this example, you will...*

* Configure your Visual Studio instance to download NuGet packages from your local repository manager.

* Consume components from NuGet Gallery via {pro}.

*Let's get started*

Your {pro} Trial instance has been preconfigured with the following NuGet repositories:

* A Proxy Repository for NuGet Gallery

* A Hosted Repository for your internal .NET components

* A Group which combines both the NuGet Gallery Proxy and the Hosted
  NuGet Repository

.NuGet Repositories in Repository List Accessed Using the List Filter Feature
image::figs/web/eval-nuget.png[scale=50]


To consume .NET components from {pro} you will need to install the NuGet feature in Visual Studio as referenced in
<<eval-prereq-nuget>> and configure it appropriately:

. Open {pro}, click on 'Repositories' in the left-hand
   navigation menu and locate the 'NuGet Group' repository group. This
   is the aggregating group from which Visual Studio should download
   packages. Click on this repository group in the list of
   repositories.

. Select the NuGet tab below the list of repositories with the NuGet
    Group selected and copy the URL in the 'Package Source' field to
    your clipboard. The
    value should be
    +http://localhost:8081/nexus/service/local/nuget/nuget-group/+.

. Now in Visual Studio, right-click on a Visual Studio project and
select 'Add Library Reference'.

. In the 'Add Library Package Reference', click on the 'Settings'
button in the lower left-hand corner.

. This will bring up an 'Options' button.  Remove the initial NuGet repository location and replace it with a
reference to your repository manager instance.  Clicking 'Add' to add the reference.

. Click 'OK' to return to the 'Add Library Package Reference' dialog.

. Select the 'Online' item in the left-hand side of the dialog. At this point Visual Studio will interrogate your
repository manager for a list of NuGet packages.

. You can now locate the package you need and install it.  

. To verify that the NuGet package components are being served from {pro} you can return to the web interface and
browse the local storage of your NuGet proxy repository.
 
NOTE: Watch http://www.youtube.com/v/HXksSdhoqbA?version=3[this video] of the steps being performed in Visual
Studio.

The above instructions were created using Visual Studio 10 Web Developer Express. Your configuration steps may
vary if you are using a different version of Visual Studio.

.Conclusion
****
When your developers are consuming OSS .NET components through a proxy of NuGet gallery your builds will become
more stable and reliable over time. Every component will be downloaded to {pro} only once, and every following
download will enjoy the performance and reliability of a local download from the cache.
****

=== Publish and Share .NET Components with NuGet

{pro} can improve collaboration and control, while increasing the speed of .NET development. NuGet defines a
packaging standard that organizations can use to share components.

If your organization needs to share .NET components, you can publish these components to a hosted NuGet repository
on the repository manager. This makes it easy for projects within your organization to start publishing and
consuming NuGet packages using {pro} as a central hub for collaboration.

Once NuGet packages are published to your repository manager instance they are automatically added to the NuGet
repository group, making your internal packages as easy to consume as packages from NuGet Gallery.

*In this example, you will...*

* Publish NuGet packages to a Hosted NuGet repository.

* Distribute custom .NET components using {pro}.

*Let's get started:*

. Follow the example from <<eval-nuget-proxy>> to set up proxying of NuGet packages from the repository manager.

. Activate the NuGet API Security Realm ->
  http://books.sonatype.com/nexus-book/reference/configxn-sect-customizing-server.html#_security_settings[Read
  more...]

. Create a NuGet Package in Visual Studio. Creating a package for deployment 
can be done with the pack command of the nuget command line tool or 
within Visual Studio. Detailed documentation can be found on 
the http://docs.nuget.org/[NuGet website].

. Publish a NuGet Package to {pro} -> http://books.sonatype.com/nexus-book/reference/nuget-deploying_packages_to_nuget_hosted_repositories.html[Read more...]


.Conclusion
****
Once NuGet packages are published to your {pro} instance and are available via a NuGet repository group, your
 internal packages will be as easy to consume as packages from NuGet Gallery.

This will greatly improve sharing of components and reuse of development efforts across your teams and allow you
 to modularize your software.

****

=== Enterprise Deployments 

{inrmonly}

==== Scaling {pro} Deployments for Distributed Development

Avoid downtime by deploying {pro} in a highly available configuration!  With the {pro} feature Smart Proxy, two
distributed teams can work with local instances of the repository manager that will inform each other of new
components as they are published. Smart Proxy is an enhanced proxy setup with push notifications and potential
prefetching of components. It allows you to keep proxy repositories on multiple repository managers in sync
without sacrificing performance.

A team in New York can use a {pro} instance in New York and a team in Sydney can use an instance in Australia. If
a component has been deployed, deleted, or changed, the source repository notifies the proxy. Both teams are
assured that the repository manager will never serve stale content. This simple mechanism makes it possible to
build complex distributed networks of repository manager instances relying on this publish/subscribe approach.

*In this example, you will...*

* Setup two instances of {pro}.

* Configure one instance to proxy the hosted instances of the other
  instance.

* Configure the proxying instance to subscribe to Smart Proxy events.

*Let's get started*

. Enable Smart Proxy publishing -> http://www.sonatype.com/books/nexus-book/reference/smartproxy-enabling_smart_proxy_publishing.html[Read more...]

. Establish trust between repository managers -> http://www.sonatype.com/books/nexus-book/reference/smartproxy-establishing_trust.html[Read more...]

. Configure Smart Proxy for specific repositories -> http://www.sonatype.com/books/nexus-book/reference/smartproxy-repository_specific_smart_proxy_configuration.html[Read more...]

.Conclusion
**** 
With Smart Proxy, two or more distributed instances of {pro} can stay up to date with the latest published
 components. If you have distributed development teams, Smart Proxy will allow both teams to access a
 high-performance proxy that is guaranteed to be up to date.
