== Background

So you’ve downloaded {pro} - great! But what is a repository
manager? How do you evaluate a repository manager? How can you understand
how the features of Nexus map to your organization’s needs?

This guide helps you with this task, answers these and other questions
and gives you pointers to further resources and next steps.

It is based on evaluating {pro} and provides a
number of step by step instructions for typical use cases. Some of
these can be used for {oss} as well.
