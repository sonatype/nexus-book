== Ruby, RubyGems and Gem Repositories

{inall}

=== Introduction

For developers using the https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] programming
language, the +gem+ tool serves as their package management
solution. In fact, since version 1.9 of Ruby, it has been included as
part of the default Ruby library. Packages are called 'gems' and, just
like all package managers, this allows for ease of use when
distributing programs or libraries.

Of course, package management really only goes as far as improving
distribution.  A great feat certainly, but to really find success, a
development community needs to exists. At the heart of every
development community, especially those like Ruby, where open source
projects are one of the most critical elements, the community needs a
place to host and share their projects.

Enter link:https://rubygems.org[RubyGems hosted at rubygems.org] - the
most popular and leading gem hosting service supporting the Ruby
community. Here, a large variety of open source Ruby projects supply
their gems for download to all users.

Ruby has been a successful platform for developers for a long
time now. The popularity of Ruby and therefore the usage of gems and
Gem repositories means that lots of teams are downloading and
exchanging lots of components on a regular basis. Obviously, this can
(and does) become a crunch on resources, not to mention a pain to
manage.

Luckily {pro} and {oss} support Gem repositories. A user can connect to the repositry manager to downloads gems
from RubyGems, create proxies to other repositories, and host their own or third-party gems. Any gem downloaded
via the repository manager needs to be downloaded from the remote repository, like RubyGems, only once and is then
available internally from the repository manager. Gems pushed to the repository manager automatically become
available to everyone else in your organization.  Using the repository manager as a proxy avoids the overhead of
teams and individual developers having to repeatedly download components or share components in a haphazard and
disorganized manner.

IMPORTANT: Gem repository support is a feature of version 2.11 and
higher, and is available in {pro} and {oss} editions.

The following features are included as part of the Gem repository support:

* Proxy repository for connecting to remote Gem repositories and caching gems on the repository manager to avoid
  duplicate downloads and wasted bandwidth and time
* Hosted repository for hosting gems package and providing them to
  your users
* Repository groups for merging multiple hosted and proxy Gem
  repositories and easily exposing them as one URL to all users

TIP: None of this functionality requires Ruby (or any extra tooling) to be installed on the operating system
running the repository manager. Ruby specific details are implemented using a bundled http://jruby.org/[JRuby].

[[ruby-proxying-registries]]
=== Proxying Gem Repositories

To reduce duplicate downloads and improve download speeds for your
developers, continuous integration servers and other systems using
+gem+, you should proxy the RubyGems repository and any other
repositories you require.

To proxy an external Gem repository, like RubyGems, simply create
a new 'Proxy Repository' as documented in
<<confignx-sect-manage-repo>>. The 'Provider' has to be set to
+Rubygems+. The 'Remote Storage Location' has to be set to the URL of
the remote repository you want to proxy. The official URL for
Rubygems.org is

----
https://rubygems.org
----

This main configuration for proxying RubyGems is visible in
<<fig-rubygems-proxy>>. Further configuration details are available in
<<confignx-sect-manage-repo>>.

[[fig-rubygems-proxy]]

If you are using {pro} and are proxying a repository via HTTPS, you can get the certificate added to the
repository manager truststore to simplify management using the SSL tab of the repository configuration.

<<scheduled-tasks, Scheduled tasks>> can be used to purge broken
metadata of a proxy gem repository as well as to synchronize the
metadata files of a proxy gem repository.

[[ruby-private-registries]]
=== Private Hosted Gem Repositories

A private Gem repository on repository manager can be used as target to push your own gems as well as third-party
gems and subsequently provide them to your users. It is good practice to create two separate hosted Gem
repositories for internal and third-party gems.

To create a hosted Gem repository, simply create a new 'Hosted
Repository' and set the 'Provider' to +Rubygems+ as documented in
<<confignx-sect-manage-repo>>. A sample configuration for an internal
hosted Gem repository is displayed in <<fig-rubygems-hosted>>.

[[fig-rubygems-hosted]]
.Example Configuration for a Private Gem Repository
image::figs/web/rubygems-hosted.png[scale=50]

The Gem repository information is immediately updated as gems are
pushed to the repository or deleted from it.

A scheduled task can be used to rebuild the metadata of a hosted gem
repository and can be configured as documented in <<scheduled-tasks>>.

[[ruby-grouping-registries]]
=== Grouping Gem Repositories

A repository group is the recommended way to expose all your Gem repositories to your users, without needing any
further client side configuration after initial setup. A repository group allows you to expose the aggregated
content of multiple proxy and hosted Gem repositories with one URL to +gem+ and other tools.  This is possible for
Gem repositories by creating a new 'Repository Group' with the 'Provider' set to +Rubygems+ as documented in
<<repository-groups>>.

A typical, useful example would be to group the proxy repository that
proxies the RubyGems repository, a hosted Gem repository with
internal software gems, and another hosted Gem repository with
third-party gems. The configuration for such a setup is displayed in
<<fig-rubygems-group>>.

[[fig-rubygems-group]]
.A Gem Repository Group Combining the RubyGems Proxy Repository and Two Private Gem Repositories
image::figs/web/rubygems-group.png[scale=50]

Using the 'Repository Path' of the repository group as your Gem
repository URL in your client tool gives you access to the gems in
all three repositories with one URL.

Any new gem added to the remote proxy Gem repositories or the hosted
Gem repositories becomes immediately available to all users of the Gem
repository group. Adding a new proxy Gem repository to the group makes
all gems immediately available to the users as well.


[[rubygems-configuring]]
=== Using Gem Repositories

Once you have configured the repository manager with the Gem repository group, you can add it to your
configuration for the +gem+ command line tool.

You can add the URL gems repository or better the Gem repository group using the 'Repository Path' from the
repository list with a command like

----
gem sources --add http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/groups/gems-all/
----

In order to take full advantage of the repository manager and the proxying of gems, you should remove any other
sources. By default +https://rubygems.org/+ is configured and this can be removed with

----
$ gem sources --remove https://rubygems.org/
https://rubygems.org/ removed from sources
----

Subsequently you should clear the local cache with

----
$ gem sources -c
*** Removed specs cache ***
----

To check a successful configuration you can run 

----
$ gem sources
*** CURRENT SOURCES ***

http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/groups/gems-all/
----

With this setup completed any installation of new gems with +gem install GEMNAME+ e.g., +gem install rake+ will
download from the repository manager.

By default read access is available to anonymous access and no further configuration is necessary. If your
repository manager requires authentication, you have to add the 'Basic Auth' authentication details to the sources
configuration:

----
$ gem sources --add
http://myuser:mypassword@localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/gems-all/
----

If you are using the popular http://bundler.io/[Bundler] tool for tracking and installing
gems, you need to install it with +gem+:

----
$ gem install bundle
Fetching: bundler-1.7.7.gem (100%)
Successfully installed bundler-1.7.7
Fetching: bundle-0.0.1.gem (100%)
Successfully installed bundle-0.0.1
Parsing documentation for bundle-0.0.1
Installing ri documentation for bundle-0.0.1
Parsing documentation for bundler-1.7.7
Installing ri documentation for bundler-1.7.7
Done installing documentation for bundle, bundler after 4 seconds
2 gems installed
----

To use the repository manager with Bundler, you have to configure the Gem repository group as a mirror:

----
$ bundle config mirror.http://rubygems.org
http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/gems-all
----

You can confirm the configuration succeeded by checking the configuration:

----
$ bundle config
Settings are listed in order of priority. 
The top value will be used.
mirror.http://rubygems.org
Set for the current user (/Users/manfred/.bundle/config): 
"http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/gems-all"
----

With this configuration completed, you can create a Gemfile and run
+bundle install+ as usual and any downloads of gem files will be using
the Gem repository group configured as a mirror.


[[ruby-deploying-packages]]
=== Pushing Gems

At this point you have set up the various Gem repositories on the repository manager (proxy, hosted, and group),
and are successfully using them for installing new gems on your systems. A next step can be to push gems to hosted
Gem repositories to provide them to other users. All this can be achieved on the command line with the features of
the +nexus+ gem.

The +nexus+ gem is available at RubyGems and provides features to interact with {pro} including pushing gems to a
hosted Gem repository including the necessary authentication.

You can install the nexus gem with

----
$ gem install nexus
Fetching: nexus-1.2.1.gem (100%)
...
Successfully installed nexus-1.2.1
Parsing documentation for nexus-1.2.1
Installing ri documentation for nexus-1.2.1
Done installing
----

After successful installation you can push your gem to a desired repository. The initial invocation will request
the URL for the GEM repository and the credentials needed for deployment. Subsequent pushes will used the cached
information.

----
$gem nexus example-1.0.0.gem
Enter the URL of the rubygems repository on a Nexus server
URL:   http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/gems-internal
The Nexus URL has been stored in ~/.gem/nexus
Enter your Nexus credentials
Username:   admin
Password:
Your Nexus credentials has been stored in /Users/manfred/.gem/nexus
Uploading gem to Nexus...
Created
----

By default pushing an identical version to the repository, as known as
redeployment, is not allowed in a hosted Gem repository. If desired
this configuration can be changed, although we suggest to change the
version for each new deployment instead.

The +nexus+ gem provides a number of additional features and
parameters. You can access the documentation with

----
$ gem help nexus 
----

E.g. you can access a list of all configured repositories with

----
$gem nexus --all-repos

DEFAULT:
http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/gems-internal
