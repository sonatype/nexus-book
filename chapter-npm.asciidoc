== Node Packaged Modules and npm Registries

=== Introduction

The command line tool +npm+ is a package management solution for
Javascript-based development. It is used to create and use 'node
packaged modules' and is built into the popular Javascript platform
http://www.nodejs.org/[Node.js], which is mostly used for server-side
application development.

The npm registry at https://www.npmjs.org/[https://www.npmjs.org/] is
the default package registry, from which components can be retrieved.
It contains a large number of open source packages for Node.js
based server-side application development, build tools like 'bower' or
'grunt' and many other packages for a variety of use cases.

Nexus supports the npm registry format for proxy repositories. This
allows you to take advantage of the packages in the npm registry and
other public registries without incurring repeated downloads of
packages, since the will be proxied in Nexus.

In addition, Nexus supports running your own private registry - also
known as a hosted repository using the +npm+ format. You can share
internally developed, proprietary packages within your organization
via these private registries allowing you to collaborate efficiently
across development teams with a central package exchange and storage
location.

To simplify configuration Nexus supports aggregation of npm
registries. This allows you to expose all the external package from
the npm registry and other public registries as well as the private
registries as one registry, which greatly simplifies client
configuration.

To share a package or tool with npm, you create a npm package and
store it in the Nexus-based npm registry. Similarly, you can use
packages others have created and made available in their NPM
repositories by proxying them or downloading the packages and
installing them in your own private registry for third party packages.

IMPORTANT: npm support is a feature of Nexus 2.10 and higher and is
available in Nexus Pro and Nexus OSS and requires npm
version 1.4 and above.

[[npm-proxying-registries]]
=== Proxying npm Registries

To reduce duplicate downloads and improve download speeds for your
developers and CI servers, you should proxy the registry hosted at
-https://registry.npmjs.org[https://registry.npmjs.org]. It is
accessed directly by npm out-of-the-box. You can also proxy any other
registries you require.

To proxy an external npm registry, you simply create a new 'Proxy
Repository' as documented in <<confignx-sect-manage-repo>>. The
'Provider' has to be set to +NPM+. The 'Remote Storage Location' has
to be set to the URL of the remote repository you want to proxy. The official
URL for the main npm registry is 

----
https://registry.npmjs.org
----

A complete configuration for proxying the default npm registry is visible in
<<fig-npm-proxy>>.

[[npm-private-registries]]
=== Private npm Registries

A private npm registry can be used to upload your own packages as well
as third-party packages. You can create a private npm registry by
setting up a hosted repository with the npm format in Nexus.It is good
practice to create two separate hosted repositories for these
purposes.

To create a hosted repository with npm format, simply create a new 'Hosted
Repository' and set the 'Provider' to +npm+ as documented in
<<confignx-sect-manage-repo>>. A sample configuration for an internal
releases npm hosted repository is displayed in <<fig-npm-hosted>>.

The npm registry information is immediately updated as packages are
deployed or deleted from the repository.

WARNING: Browsing the registry storage or searching for packages in
Nexus not yet supported.

The scheduled tasks to recreate the npm metadata database based on the
components in a hosted repository and to back up the database are
documented in <<scheduled-tasks>>.

[[npm-grouping-registries]]
=== Grouping npm Registries

A repository group is the recommended way to expose all your npm
registries repositories from Nexus to your users, without needing any
further client side configuration. A repository group allows you to
expose the aggregated content of multiple proxy and hosted
repositories with one URL to npm and other tools. This is possible for
npm repositories by creating a new 'Repository Group' with the
'Provider' set to +npm+ as documented in <<repository-groups>>.

A typical, useful example would be to group the proxy repository that:
proxies the npm registry, a npm, hosted repository with internal
software packages and another npm, hosted repository with third-party
packages. The configuration for such a setup is displayed in
<<fig-npm-group>>.

Using the 'Repository Path' of the repository group as your npm
repository URL in your client tool will give you access to the
packages in all three repositories with one URL. Any new packages
added as well as any new repositories added to the group will
automatically be available.

[[npm-configuring]]
=== Configuring npm 

Once you have set up your hosted and proxy repositories for npm
packages, and created a repository group to merge them, you can access
them with the +npm+ tool on the command line as one registry.

You can configure the registry used by +npm+ in your +.npmrc+ file
located in your user's home directory. If the file does not exist
simply create it and add the registry configuration with the URL of
your npm repository group. You can see the public URL of your group
repository in the repository list in the 'Repository Path' column.

.Registry configuration in +.npmrc+
----
registry = http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/groups/npm-all/
-----

With this configuration any npm commands will use the new registry
from Nexus. The command line output will reference the URLs. E.g. 

----
$ npm install bower
npm install bower
npm http GET http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/groups/npm-all/bower
npm http 200 http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/groups/npm-all/bower
npm http GET http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/groups/npm-all/bower-config
npm http GET http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/groups/npm-all/bower-endpoint-parser
...
----

By default any anonymous user has read access to the repositories and
repository groups. If desired, Nexus can be configured to require
authentication by adding +always-auth=true+ to the +.npmrc+ file and
adding the encoded authentication details as documented in
<<npm-deploying-packages>>.

=== Publishing npm Packages

Publishing your own packages to a npm hosted repository allows you to share
packages across your organization or with external partners. 

The npm publish command uses a +registry+ configuration value to know where
to publish your package. There are several ways to change the registry value 
to point at your Nexus hosted npm repository.

Since the +.npmrc+ file usually contains a registry value intended only for getting new packages,
a simple way to override this value is to provide a registry to the +publish+ command:

----
npm publish --registry http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/npm-internal/ 
----

Alternately, you can edit your package.json file and add a +publishConfig+ section:

----
  "publishConfig" : {
    "registry" : "http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/npm-internal/"
  },
----

Publishing requires authentication. It can be configured by adding an +_auth+ value to
+.npmrc+. The value has to be generated by base64-encoding the string
of +username:password+.  You can create this encoded string with the
command line call +openssl+ e.g.: for the default +admin+ user of Nexus:

----
echo -n 'admin:admin123' | openssl base64
----

Other tools for the encoding are +uuencode+ or, for Windows users,
+certutil+. To use +certutil+ on Windows you need to put the credentials
to be encoded into a file:

----
admin:admin123
----

Then run:

----
c:\certutil /encode in.txt out.txt
----

After this the base64 encoded credentials can be found in between the
begin and end certiicate lines in the output file:

----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
YWRtaW46YWRtaW4xMjM=
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
----

Once you have the encoded credentials the value as well as author 
information can then be added to the +.npmrc+ file: 

----
init.author.name = Jane Doe
init.author.email = jane@example.com
init.author.url = http://blog.example.com
# an email is required to publish npm packages
email=jane@example.com
_auth=YWRtaW46YWRtaW4xMjM=
----

TIP: Whatever tool you use to generate the encoded username and
password string, try to encode the string +admin:admin123+, which
should result in +YWRtaW46YWRtaW4xMjM=+. Another example for a valid
setup is +jane:testpassword123+ resulting in
+amFuZTp0ZXN0cGFzc3dvcmQxMjM=+.

With this configuration you can run +npm publish+ for your
package. More information about package creation can be found on the
https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-publish.html[npm website].

Once a package is published to the private registry in Nexus, any
other developers or build servers, that access Nexus via the
repository group have instant access to the packages.
