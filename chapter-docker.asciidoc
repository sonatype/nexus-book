== Private Registry for Docker
{inall}

[[docker-introduction]]
=== Introduction

https://www.docker.com/[Docker] containers and their usage have revolutionized the way applications and the
underlying operating system are packaged and deployed to development, testing and production systems.

The creation of the http://opencontainers.org/[Open Container Initiative], and the involvement of a large number
of stakeholders, guarantees that the ecosystem of tools around the lightweight containers and their usage will
continue to flourish.

https://hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub] is the original registry for Docker container images and it is being joined by
more and more other publicly available registries such as the https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/[Google
Container Registry] and others.

{pro} and {oss} support Docker registries as the Docker repository format for hosted and proxy repositories. You
can expose these repositories to the client-side tools directly or as a repository group, which is a repository 
that merges and exposes the contents of multiple repositories in one convenient URL.

This allows you to reduce time and bandwidth usage for accessing Docker images in a registry as well as share your
images within your organization in a hosted repository. Users can then launch containers based on those images,
resulting in a completely private Docker registry with all the features available in the repository manager.

TIP: Docker is a fast moving project and requires usage of current operating system versions and tools. For
example, usage of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is simply not supported. Please use the
https://docs.docker.com/[official documentation] as reference and help for your usage.

[[docker-ssl-connector]]
=== SSL and Repository Connector Configuration

Docker relies on secure connections using SSL to connect to the repositories. You are therefore required to expose
the repository manager to your client tools via HTTPS. This can be configured via an external proxy server or
directly with the repository manager. Further details can be found in <<ssl-inbound>>.

Interaction of the `docker` client with repositories requires specific ports to be used. These can be configured
in the repository configuration in the 'Repository Connectors' section. In order for this to work on your 
network, you need to ensure that the chosen ports are available in your organization and not used by some other 
application, and that no firewall or other network configuration prevents connectivity.

NOTE: The `docker` client does not allow a context as part of the path to a registry, as the namespace and image
 name are embedded in the URLs it uses. This is why requests to repositories on the repository manager are served
 on a specific and separate port from the rest of the application instead of how most other repositories serve
 content via a path i.e. `<nexus-hostname>/<repositoryName>/<path to content>`.

The recommended minimal configuration requires one port for a Docker repository group used for read access to all
repositories and one port for each hosted Docker repository that will receive push events from your users. The
'Repository Connectors' configuration displayed in <<fig-repository-connectors>> is available in the 
configuration for proxy and hosted Docker repositories as well as Docker repository groups.

If you have configured the repository manager to use HTTPS directly, you have to configure a HTTPS repository
connector. If an external proxy server translates incoming HTTPS requests to HTTP and forwards the request to the
repository manager via HTTP you have to configure the respective HTTP port.

TIP: A configured context-path for the user interface does not affect the repository connector URLs used by 
Docker. E.g. if your repository manager instance is configured to be available at http://localhost:8081/nexus 
instead of the default root context http://localhost:8081/, the URLs for your Docker repositories will still only 
use the configured port for the repository and omit the context path in the URL. This is a side-effect of the the 
fact that Docker does not support context paths in the registry API.

==== Tips for SSL Certificate Usage

{nxrm} is not configured with HTTPS connectors by default as it requires an SSL certificate 
to be generated and configured manually.

The requirement of Docker to use HTTPS forces the usage of SSL certificates. By default, Docker looks up the
validity of the certificate by checking with certificate authorities. If you purchased a certificate
that is registered with these authorities, all functionality works as desired. 

If you create a certificate yourself with tools such as `openssl`, it is self-signed and not registered. Using a 
self-signed certificate requires further configuration steps to ensure that Docker can explicitly trust it.
 
WARNING: Docker Daemon can stand up instances with the `--insecure-registry` flag to skip validation of 
a self-signed certificate. But the repository manager does not support the use of the flag, as it generates known 
bugs and other implementation issues.

To generate a trustworthy self-signed certificate for the repository manager use keytool, a utility that 
lets you manage your own private key pairs and certificates. See our 
https://support.sonatype.com/hc/en-us/articles/217542177[knowledge base article] to learn how to configure the 
utlilty.


[[docker-registry-api]]
=== Support for Docker Registry API

The Docker client tools interact with a repository via the registry API. It is available in version 1 (V1) and
version 2 (V2). The newer V2 will completely replace the old V1 in the future. Currently Docker Hub and other
registries as well as other tools use V2, but in many cases fall back to V1. E.g., search is currently only
implemented in V1.

{nxrm} supports V1 as well as V2 of the API. All Docker repository configurations contain a section to
configure 'Docker Registry API Support'. If you activate 'Enable Docker V1 API' for a repository it is enabled to
use V1 as a fallback from V2. Without this option any V1 requests result in errors from the client tool.

TIP: Generally V1 support is only needed for repository groups that will be used for command line-based searches, 
when any client side tools in use require V1 or when a upstream proxy repository requires V1.  If you are unsure 
if your setup uses these or V1, it is recommended to activate V1 support as there should be no harm if it is not needed.

[[docker-proxy]]
=== Proxy Repository for Docker

Docker Hub is the common registry used by all image creators and consumers.  To reduce duplicate downloads and
improve download speeds for your developers and CI servers, you should proxy Docker Hub and any other registry you
use for Docker images.

To proxy a Docker registry, you simply create a new 'docker (proxy)' as documented in <<admin-repositories>> in
details.

Minimal configuration steps are:

- Define 'Name'
- Define URL for 'Remote storage'
- 'Enable Docker V1 API' support, if required by the remote repository
- Select correct 'Docker index', further configure 'Location of Docker index' if needed
- Select 'Blob store' for 'Storage'

Optionally you can configure 'Repository Connectors' as explained in <<docker-ssl-connector>>, although typically 
read access is done via a repository group and not a proxy repository directly, and write access is done against a
hosted repository.

The 'Remote Storage' has to be set to the URL of the remote registry you want to proxy. The configuration for
proxying Docker Hub uses the URL `https://registry-1.docker.io` for the 'Remote storage' URL.

The 'Proxy' configuration for a Docker proxy repository includes a configuration URL to access the 'Docker
Index'. The index is used for requests related to searches, users, docker tokens and other aspects. The registry
and the index are typically co-hosted by the same provider, but can use different URLs. E.g. the index for Docker
Hub is exposed at `https://index.docker.io/`.

The default option 'Use proxy registry (specified above)' will attempt to retrieve any index data from the same
URL configured as the 'Remote storage' URL.

The option to 'Use Docker Hub' fulfills any index related requests by querying the Docker Hub index at
`https://index.docker.io/`. This configuration is desired when the proxy repository is Docker Hub itself or any of
its mirrors.

The option to use a 'Custom index' allows you to specify the URL of the index for the remote repository.

It is important to configure a correct pair of 'Remote Storage' URL and 'Docker Index' URL. In case of a mismatch,
search results potentially do not reflect the content of the remote repository and other problems can occur.

TIP: Just to recap, in order to configure a proxy for Docker Hub you configure the 'Remote Storage' URL to
https://registry-1.docker.io, enable Docker V1 API support and for the choice of 'Docker Index' select the 'Use 
Docker Hub' option.

[[docker-hosted]]
=== Hosted Repository for Docker (Private Registry for Docker)

A hosted repository using the Docker repository format is typically called a private Docker registry. It can be
used to upload your own container images as well as third-party images. It is common practice to create two
separate hosted repositories for these purposes.

To create a Docker hosted repository, simply create a new 'docker (hosted)' repository as documented in
<<admin-repositories>>.

Minimal configuration steps are:

- Define 'Name'
- Select 'Blob store' for 'Storage'

If you add a 'Repository Connectors' configuration as documented in <<docker-ssl-connector>> you can `push` 
images to this repository, and subsequently access them directly from the hosted repository or ideally from the 
Docker repository group as documented in <<docker-group>>.

By default this setup will allow repeated deployment of images. If you want to enforce new deployments using
different versions, set the 'Deployment Policy' to 'Disable Redeploy'.

[[docker-group]]
=== Repository Groups for Docker

A repository group is the recommended way to expose all your repositories for read access to your users. It allows
you to pull images from all repositories in the group without needing any further client side configuration after
the initial setup. A repository group allows you to expose the aggregated content of multiple proxy and hosted
repositories with one URL to your tools.

To create a Docker repository group, simply create a new 'docker (group)' repository as documented in
<<admin-repositories>>.

Minimal configuration steps are:

- Define 'Name'
- Select 'Blob store' for 'Storage'
- Add Docker repositories to the 'Members' list in the desired order

Typically the member list includes a mixture of proxy and hosted repositories to allow access to public as well as
private images.

Using the 'Repository Connectors' port of the repository group and the URL of the repository manager in your 
client tool gives you access to the container images in all repositories from the group. Any new images added as 
well as any new repositories added to the group will automatically be available.

TIP: Check out this repository configuration demonstrated in link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxCztw5MfAw[a
video].

=== Authentication

If access to a repository requires the user to be authenticated, `docker` will check for authentication access in
the `~/.docker/config.json` file.  If authentication is not found, some actions will prompt for authentication but 
otherwise a `docker login` command will be required before the actions can be performed. Typically this is 
required when <<anonymous, anonymous access>> to the repository manager is disabled or the operation requires 
authentication.

The `docker login` command observes the following syntax for the desired repository or repository group:

----
docker login <nexus-hostname>:<repository-port>
----

Provide your repository manager credentials of username and password as well as an email address. This
authentication is persisted in `~/.docker/config.json` and reused for any subsequent interactions against that
repository.  Individual login operations must be performed for each repository and repository group you want to
access in an authenticated manner.

TIP: Specifically when planning to push to a repository a preemptive login operation is advisable as it removes
the need for use interaction and is therefore suitable for continuous integration server setups and automated 
scenarios.

////
=== Configuration
Each repository in the repository manager accessed from Docker
has to be configured. An example set for docker accessing a {nxrm} running on `localhost` with a hosted repository
on port `18444` and a repository group on port `18443` is:
////

=== Accessing Repositories 

You can browse Docker repositories in the user interface and inspect the components and assets and their details
as documented in <<browse-browse>>.

When using the 'docker' command line client, or any other tools using the repository manager indirectly, the
common structure for commands can be:

----
docker <command> <nexus-hostname>:<repository-port>/<namespace>/<image>:<tag>
docker search <nexus-hostname>:<repository-port>/<search-term>

----

with

command:: a docker command such as 'push' or 'pull'
nexus-hostname:: the IP number or hostname of your repository manager
repository-port:: the port configured as the repository connector for the specific repository or repository group
namespace:: the optional namespace of the specific image reflecting the owner, if left out this will silently 
default to '/library' and utilize Docker Hub
image:: the name of the Docker image
tag:: the optional tag of the image, defaulting to 'latest' when omitted
search-term:: the search term or name of the image to search for

The most important aspects are to know and use the correct hostname for the repository manager and the port for
the desired repository or repository group.

[[docker-search]]
=== Searching

Searching for Docker images can be performed in the user interface as described in <<search-components>>. This
search will find all Docker images that are currently stored in repositories, either because they have been pushed
to a hosted repository or they have been proxied from an upstream repository and cached in the repository manager.

The more common use case for a Docker user is to search for images on the command line:

----
$ docker search postgres
NAME      DESCRIPTION                                  STARS  OFFICIAL  AUTOMATED
postgres  The PostgreSQL object-relational database... 1025   [OK]
...
----

By default this search uses Docker Hub as preconfigured in `docker` and will only find images available there. A
more powerful search is provided by the repository manager when searching against a repository group. An example
looking for a `postgres` image on {oss} running on the host `nexus.example.com` and exposing a repository group
with a repository connector port of 18443 looks like this:

----
docker search nexus.example.com:18443/postgres
----

The results include all images found in the repositories that are part of the repository group. This includes any
private images you have pushed to your hosted repositories. In addition it includes all results returned from the
remote repositories configured as proxy repositories in the group. Searching in a specific repository can be
achieved by using the repository connector port for the specific repository.


[[docker-pull]]
=== Pulling Images

Downloading images, also known as pulling, from the repository manager can be performed with the `docker pull`
command.  The only necessary additions are the hostname or IP address of the repository manager as well as the
repoisitory connector port for the repository or repository group to download from:

----
docker pull <nexus-hostname>:<repository-port>/<image>
----

The preferred setup is to proxy all relevant sources of public/private images you want to use, with Docker Hub
being the most common choice. Then configure one or more hosted repositories to contain your own images, and
expose these repositories through one repository group.

Examples for various images from {nxrm} running on the host `nexus.example.com` and exposing a repository
group with a repository connector port of 18443 are:

----
docker pull nexus.example.com:18443/ubuntu
docker pull nexus.example.com:18443/bitnami/node
docker pull nexus.example.com:18443/postgres:9.4
----

These snippets download the official `ubuntu` image, the `node` image from the user `bitnami` and the version 9.4
of the `postgres` image. Official images such as `ubuntu` or `postgres` belong to the `library` user on Docker Hub
and will therefore show up as `library/ubuntu` and `library/postgres` in the repository manager.

After a successful `pull` you can start the container with `run`.

[[docker-push]]
=== Pushing Images

Sharing an image can be achieved, by publishing it to a hosted repository. This is completely private and requires
you to `tag` and `push` the image. When tagging an image, you can use the image identifier (imageId).  It is 
listed when showing the list of all images with `docker images`. Syntax and an example (using imageId) for 
creating a tag are:

----
docker tag <imageId or imageName> <nexus-hostname>:<repository-port>/<image>:<tag>
docker tag af340544ed62 nexus.example.com:18444/hello-world:mytag
----

Once the tag, which can be equivalent to a version, is created successfully, you can confirm its creation with 
`docker images` and issue the push with the syntax:

----
docker push <nexus-hostname>:<repository-port>/<image>:<tag>
----

IMPORTANT: Note that the port needs to be the repository connector port configured for the *hosted*
repository to which you want to push to. You can not push to a repository group or a proxy repository.


A sample output could look like this:

----
$ docker push nexus.example.com:18444/hello-world:labeltest
The push refers to a repository [nexus.example.com:18444/hello-world] (len: 1)
Sending image list
Pushing repository nexus.example.com:18444/hello-world (1 tags)
535020c3e8ad: Image successfully pushed
af340544ed62: Image successfully pushed
Pushing tag for rev [af340544ed62] on
{https://nexus.example.com:18444/repository/docker-internal/v1/repositories/hello-world/tags/labeltest}
----

Now, this updated image is available in the repository manager and can be pulled by anyone with access to the
repository, or the repository group, containing the image. Pulling the image from the repository group exposed at
port 18443 can be done with:

----
docker pull nexus.example.com:18443/hello-world:labeltest
----

Prior to push, and depending on your configuration, repository manager login credentials may be required before a
push or pull can occur.

TIP: Searching, Browsing, Pushing and Pulling are all showcased in
link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2jH9LgeeI8[this video].

Pushing large images can result in failures due to network interruptions and other issues. These partial uploads
result in temporary storage for these transfers in the repository manager filling up. The task 'Purge incomplete
docker uploads' can be configured to delete these files. If you also tend to upload images to the same tag 
repeatedly, this can leave a lot of dangling images around, consuming a lot of space.  The task 'Purge unused 
docker manifests and images' can be configured to remove these files.  Further information about these tasks can 
be found in <<admin-system-tasks>>.
