== Build Promotion with the Nexus Staging Suite

[[staging-sect-intro]]
=== Introduction

If you release software, you will often need to test a release before
deploying it to a production system or an externally accessible
repository. For example, if you are developing a large, enterprise web
application you may want to stage a release candidate to a staging
system and perform a series of rigorous tests before a release manager
makes a decision to either return a system to development or deploy a
system to production.

The Staging Suite in Nexus Professional allows an organization
to create a temporary staging repository and to manage the promotion
of artifacts from a staging repository to a release repository. This
ability to create an isolated, release candidate repository that can be
discarded or promoted makes it possible to support the decisions that
go into certifying a release, while the certification process is done
on the same binaries that will ultimately be released.

[[staging-sect-without]]
==== Releasing Software without a Staging Repository

Without the Staging Suite, when a developer deploys an artifact to a
hosted repository such as the Release repository, this artifact is
published and immediately made available - there is no oversight,
there is no approval or certification process. There is no chance to
test the artifact before writing the artifact to a hosted
repository. If there is a mistake in the release, often the only
option available is to republish the artifacts to the release
repository or deploy a new version of the artifacts.

While this is acceptable for some users, organizations and enterprises
with a QA cycle often need a temporary storage for potential release
candidates: a staging repository. With the Nexus Staging Suite, an
organization can automatically stage releases to a temporary
repositor,y which can then be used to test and certify a set of
artifacts, before they are published to a final release
repository. This temporary repository can then be promoted as a whole
or dropped depending on the results of testing. When used the binary
artifacts being tested and certified are the identical artifacts that
will ultimately be released and not a clean fresh build kicked off
after the certification finished as is often the case without a
staging suite being used.

[[staging-sect-how]]
==== How the Staging Suite Works

Here's how staging works in Nexus Professional:

. A developer deploys an artifact (or a set of artifacts) to Nexus
Professional

. The staging suite intercepts this deployment and determines if the
deployment matches for a staging profile 

. If a match is found a temporary staging repository is created and
the artifacts are deployed to this repository.

. Once the developer has deployed a set of artifacts to Nexus, they
will then "Close" the staging repository.

. The Staging Suite will then add this temporary staging repository to
one or more Target Repository Groups.

Once the staging repository is closed and has been added to a target
repository group, the artifacts in the staging repository are
available to Nexus users for testing and certification via a
repository group. Tests can be performed on the artifacts as if they
were already published in a hosted repository. At this point, one of
two things can happen to a staging repository:

Release:: A Nexus user can "release" a staging repository and select a
hosted repository to publish artifacts to. Releasing the contents of a
repository publishes all artifacts from the staging repository to a
hosted repository and deletes the temporary staging repository.

Drop:: A Nexus user can "drop" a staging repository. Dropping a
staging repository will remove it from any groups and delete the
temporary staging repository.

Promote:: If your Nexus installation contains Build Promotion
profiles, you will also see an option to "promote" a staging
repository to a Build Promotion Group. When you promote a staging
repository you expose the contents of that staging repository via
additional groups. Build Promotion profiles are explained in detail in
the next section.

=== Configuring the Nexus Staging Suite

==== Overview

The Staging Suite is part of the default Nexus Professional install
and is accessible with the menu items Staging Profiles, Staging
Repositories, Staging Ruleset, and Staging Upload options in the
left-hand navigation menu of the Nexus interface called Build
Promotion.

Staging Profiles define the rules by which artifact deployments from
your project are intercepted by Nexus and staged in Staging
Repositories. 

Staging Repositories are dynamically created by Nexus as they are
needed. They are temporary holding repositories for your artifacts
that are used for the different staging related steps. Using them in
the Nexus user interface users can promote the contents of the
staging repository to a hosted repository, discard them and more.

Staging Rulesets allow you to define rules that the artifacts being
deployed have to follow in order to allow successful deployment. 

Staging Upload allows you to manually upload artifacts to Nexus via
the user interface rather than by using your build system.

==== Configuring a Staging Profile

Staging profiles control the process by which artifacts are selected
for staging. When you define a Staging profile, you are defining a set
of rules which will control the way in which Nexus intercepts an
artifact deployment and what actions to perform during and after
staging the artifacts. When you click on Staging Profiles in the Nexus
menu, you will see a list of configured staging profiles.  Clicking on
Add... will display the drop-down menu shown in
<<fig-staging-add-staging-profile>>.

[[fig-staging-add-staging-profile]]
.Adding a Staging Profile
image::figs/web/staging_add-staging-profile.png[scale=60]

Selecting Staging Profile will create a new Staging Profile and
display the form shown in <<fig-staging-edit-profile>>.

<<fig-staging-edit-profile>> defines a Staging Profile named Test.  It
is configured to only intercept explicit deployments in the Profile
Selection Strategy using the Profile ID and the Nexus Staging Maven
Plugin. It uses the template "Maven2 (hosted, release)" for newly
created temporary staging repositories, and it will automatically add
closed staging repositories to the Public Repositories group.

[[fig-staging-edit-profile]]
.Creating a New Staging Profile
image::figs/web/staging_profile-edit.png[scale=60]

The form allows you to configure a profile with the following fields:

Profile ID and Deploy URL:: These two fields are only available as
read only display once a profile has been created. The Profile ID
displays the unique identifier that can be used for staging to this
repository using the Nexus Staging Maven Plugin. The Deploy URL
displays the generic staging URL that can be used with the default
Maven Deploy Plugin together with the Repository Target configuration
to intercept the deployment and move the artifacts into the Staging
Suite instead.

Profile Name:: The name of the staging profile. This can be an arbitrary
value. It is simply a convenience for the Nexus Administrator, and
it is also used to create Nexus roles that are used to grant
permissions to view and manipulate staging repositories created by
this profile.

Profile Selection Strategy:: Select the strategy used by Nexus to
select this staging profile. Explicit or Implicit is the default
behaviour and causes Nexus to select the profile by the provided
staging profile identifier and if none is provided fall back to an
automatic determination. It is necessary to be used with
the Maven Deploy Plugin and the correct staging profile is determined
using Repository Targets together with the generic Deploy URL of Nexus.
+
When using the Nexus Staging Maven Plugin for deployments, and
therefore an explicitly defined staging profile in the project POM, the
setting should be changed to Explicit Only. This will prevent the
profile from implicitly capturing a deployment in this repository due
to the matching defined and allow Nexus to ensure that the deployment
reaches the Staging Profile with the configured Staging Profile ID
even if the default matching and staging profile order could
potentially cause a deployment to end up in a different profile.

Searchable Repositories:: The default value of enabling this
feature will cause any new artifacts in this staging profile to be
added to the indexes and therefore be available in search
queries. Disable this feature to "hide" artifacts in staging.

Staging Mode:: This field contains the options "Deploy," "UI Upload,"
and "Deploy and UI Upload." This controls how artifacts can be staged
to this staging profile. If Deploy is selected, artifacts can only be
deployed using Maven to upload build artifacts. If UI Upload is
selected, users can upload artifacts to Nexus using the Nexus user
interface.

Template:: Defines the template for the format of the temporary
staging repositories created by this staging profile. The current
version of Nexus Professional provides the option "Maven2 (hosted,
release)" only. Additional templates can be supplied by plugins that
enable staging for other repository types. An example for such a
plugin is the http://code.google.com/p/nexus-yum-plugin/[Nexus Yum
Plugin].

Repository Target:: When a developer deploys an artifact to the
generic Deploy URL, the Staging Suite will check to see if the
artifact matches the patterns defined in this Repository Target. The
repository target defines the "trigger" for the creation of a staging
repository from this staging profile and is only needed for implicit
deployments with the Deploy URL and not for explicit deployments using
the Profile ID.

Release Repository:: Staged artifacts are stored in a temporary
staging repository which is made available via Target Groups. Once a
staged deployment has been successfully tested, artifacts contained in
the temporary staging repository are promoted to a hosted repository
as their final storage place. The Release Repository setting
configures this target release repository for this staging profile.

Content Type:: Nexus can create staging repositories for repositories
of type Maven2. This value is automatically selected based on the chosen
template. 

Target Groups:: When a Staging Repository is "closed" and is made
available to users and developers involved in the testing process, the
temporary Staging Repository is added to one or more Repository
Groups. This field defines those groups.

Close Repository Notification Settings:: After a developer has
deployed a set of related release artifacts, a staging repository is
"closed". This means that no further artifacts can be deployed to the
same staging repository.  A repository would be closed when a
developer is satisfied that a collection of staged artifacts is ready
to be certified by a manager or a quality assurance resource. In this
setting, it is possible to define email addresses and roles which
should be notified of a staging repository being closed. A
notification email will be sent to all specified email addresses, as
well as all Nexus users in the specified roles, informing that a
staging repository has been closed. It is also possible to select that
the creator of the staging repository receives this notification.

Promote Repository Notification Settings:: Once a closed staging
repository has been certified by whoever is responsible for testing
and checking a staged release, it can then be promoted (published) or
dropped (discarded). In this setting, it is possible to define email
addresses and Nexus security roles which should be notified of a
staging repository being promoted. A notification email will be sent
to all specified email addresses, as well as all Nexus users in the
specified roles, informing that a staging repository has been
promoted. It is also possible to select that the creator of the
staging repository receives this notification.

Drop Repository Notification Settings:: In this setting, it is
possible define email addresses and roles which should be notified of
a staging repository being dropped.  A notification email will be sent
to all specified email addresses, as well as all Nexus users in the
specified roles, informing that a staging repository has been
dropped. It is also possible to select that the creator of the staging
repository receives this notification.
           
Close Repository Staging Rulesets:: This defines the rulesets which
will be applied to a staging repository before it can be closed. If
the staging repository does not pass the rules defined in the
specified rulesets, you will be unable to close it. For more
information about rulesets, see <<staging-sect-rulesets>>.

Promote Repository Staging Rulesets:: This defines the rulesets which
will be applied to a staging repository on promotion. If the staging
repository does not pass the rules defined in the specified rulesets,
the promotion will fail with an error message supplied by the failing
rule. For more information about rulesets, see
<<staging-sect-rulesets>>.


[[staging-sect-config-build-profile]]
==== Configuring Build Promotion Profiles

A Build Promotion profile is used when you need to add an additional
step between initial staging and final release. To add a new Build
Promotion profile, open the Staging Profiles link from the Nexus menu
and click on Add... to display the drop-down menu shown in
<<fig-staging-build-promo-link>>. Select Build Promotion Profile from
this drop-down to create a new Build Promotion Profile.

[[fig-staging-build-promo-link]]
.Multi-level Staging and Build Promotion
image::figs/web/staging_add-build-promotion-orilfe.png[scale=60]

After creating a new Build Promotion profile, you will see the
form shown in <<fig-staging-build-promo-profile>>. This
form contains the following configuration fields:

Profile Name:: This is the name for the Build Promotion profile which
will be displayed in the promotion dialog shown in
<<fig-staging-promote-stating>>. This name will also be associated
with repositories created from this promotion profile.

Template:: This is the template for repositories generated by this
Build Promotion profile. The default value for this field is "Maven2
(group)".

Target Groups:: This is the most important configuration field for a
Build Promotion profile. It controls the group that promoted artifacts
will be made available through. Artifacts can be made available
through one or more groups.

[[staging-sect-security]]
==== Staging Related Security Setup

Staging Suite is controlled by three roles:

- Staging: Deployer
- Staging: Promoter
- Staging: Repositories

These roles are available as general 'admin' roles that apply to all
staging profiles with the respective access. When you create a new
staging profile, Nexus will create new roles that grant permissions
specific to that staging profile. If you created the staging profile
named 'Test', Nexus created the three new and profile specific roles:

Staging: Repositories (Test):: This role grants a user read and view
access to the staging repositories created by the 'Test' staging
profile.
 
Staging: Deployer (Test):: This role grants all of the privileges from
the Staging: Repositories role and in addition grants the user
permission to deploy artifacts, close and drop any staging repository
created by the 'Test' staging profile.

Staging: Promoter (Test):: This role grants all of the privileges from
the Staging: Deployer role and in addition grants the user permission
to promote abt staging repository created by the 'Test' staging
profile.

To perform a staged deployment, the user deploying the artifact must
have the "Staging: Deployer (admin)" role or the "Staging: Deployer"
role for a specific Staging Profile.

To configure the deployment user with the appropriate staging role,
click on Users under the Security menu in the Nexus menu. Once you see
the Users panel , click on the deployment user to edit this user's
roles. Click on the Add button in the Role Management section of the
Config tab visible in <<fig-staging-user-add-role>> for the user to be
able to add new roles to the user.


[[fig-staging-user-add-role]]
.Adding a Role to a User 
image::figs/web/staging-user-add-role.png[scale=60]

Use the Filter section with the keyword Staging and press the Apply
 Filter button to see all available staging related roles as displayed
 in <<fig-staging-user-add-role>>.

[[fig-staging-user-add-role-dialog]]
.Available Roles for Staging with a Test Staging Profile 
image::figs/web/staging-user-add-role-dialog.png[scale=30]

You should see the "Staging: Deployer (admin)" role listed as well as
the 'Test' staging profile specific role, the promoter and
repositories ones for 'admin' and 'Test' and a few staging user
interface related roles. If you need to add a specific permission to
activate a single Staging Profile, you would select that specific
role.

Once the deployment user has the "Staging: Deployer (admin)" role, you
can then use this user to deploy to the staging URL and trigger any
staging profile. Without this permission, the deployment user would
not be able to publish a staged artifact. 

In a similar fashion you can assign the promoter role to users.

==== Using Repository Targets for Staging 

The Staging Suite intercepts deployments to Nexus using Repository
Targets as documented in <<confignx-sect-managing-repo-targets>> when
using implicit matching as a profile selection strategy based on the
artifacts path in the repository.

For example, if you wanted to intercept all deployments to the
com.sonatype.sample groupId, you would create a repository target
with a pattern with a regular expression of
`^/com/sonatype/sample/.*` and use that repository target in your
Staging Profile configuration.

[[staging-sect-deployment]]
=== Configuring your Project for Deployment

Once Nexus is configured to receive artifacts in the staging suite as
documented in <<staging-sect-prepare-nexus>>, you will have to update
your project build configuration to deploy to the staging suite.

The preferred way to do this is to take advantage of the features
provided by the Nexus Staging Maven Plugin or the Nexus Staging Ant
Tasks  as documented in
<<staging-sect-deployment-nexus-staging-maven-plugin>>
and <<staging-sect-deployment-nexus-staging-ant-tasks>>.

If you need to continue to use the Maven Deploy Plugin you can read
about using it with the Nexus Staging Suite in 
<<staging-sect-deployment-maven-deploy-plugin>>. 

With all tools you can use the manual upload of your artifacts
documented in <<staging-sect-deployment-manual>>.

[[staging-sect-deployment-nexus-staging-maven-plugin]]
==== Deployment with the Nexus Staging Maven Plugin

The Nexus Staging Maven Plugin is a Nexus specific and more powerful
replacement for the Maven Deploy Plugin with a number of features
specifically geared towards usage with the Nexus Staging Suite. The
simplest usage can be configured by adding it to the project build plugins
section as an extension:

----
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.sonatype.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>nexus-staging-maven-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>1.2</version>
      <extensions>true</extensions>
      <configuration>
        <serverId>local-nexus</serverId>
        <nexusUrl>http://localhost:8081/nexus/</nexusUrl>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
----

Following Maven best practices the version should be pulled out into a
pluginManagement section in a company POM or parent POM.

This configuration works only in Maven 3 and automatically replaces
the deploy goal invocation of the Maven Deploy Plugin in the deploy
Maven lifecycle phase with the deploy goal invocation of the Nexus
Staging Maven Plugin. 

The minimal required configuration parameters for the Nexus Staging Maven Plugin are:

serverId:: the id of the server element in `settings.xml` from which
the user credentials for accessing Nexus should be retrieved 
nexusUrl:: the base URL at which the Nexus server to be used for
staging is available

With this configuration the Nexus Staging Maven Plugin will stage the
artifacts locally and connect to Nexus. Nexus will try to determine
the appropriate Staging Profile by matching the artifact path with any
repository targets configured with staging profiles with an activated
implicit profile selection strategy. If an appropriate staging profile
is found a staging repository is created on the fly and the artifacts
are deployed into it. If no profile is found the upload will fail.

To successfully deploy to your Nexus instance, you will
need to update your Maven Settings with the credentials for the
deployment user. These credentials are stored in the Maven Settings file
in ~/.m2/settings.xml. 

To add these credentials, add the following element to the servers
element in your ~/.m2/settings.xml file as shown in
<<ex-staging-deployment-credentials>>.

[[ex-staging-deployment-credentials]]
.Listing deployment credentials in Maven Settings
----
<settings>
  ...
  <servers>
    ...
    <server>
      <id>nexus</id>
      <username>deployment</username>
      <password>deployment123</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
  ...
</settings>
----

Note that the server identifier listed in
<<ex-staging-deployment-credentials>> should match the serverId
parameter you are passing to the Nexus Staging Maven Plugin and in the
example contains the default password for the Nexus deployment user -
deployment123.  You should change this password to match the
deployment password for your Nexus installation.

If more control is desired over when the plugins deploy goal is
activated or if Maven 2 is used, you have to explicitly deactivate the
Maven Deploy Plugin and replace the Maven Deploy Plugin invocation
with the Nexus Staging Maven Plugin like visible in
in <<fig-staging-maven2and3>>.

        <nexusUrl>http://localhost:8081/nexus/</nexusUrl>
        <!-- explicit matching using the staging profile id -->
        <stagingProfileId>129341e09f2ee275</stagingProfileId>
      </configuration> 
    </plugin>
...
----

The implicit matching relies on the setup of repository targets as
well as the correct order of staging profiles and is therefore an
error prone approach when many staging profiles are in use. 

The preferred way to work in this sceneario is to change the profile
selection strategy on all staging profiles to explicit only and pass
the staging profile id to the Nexus Staging Maven Plugin using the
`stagingProfileId` configuration parameter as documented above. A full
example pom.xml for deployment of snapshot as well as release builds
with the Nexus Staging Maven Plugin using explicit matching for the
staging profile and locally staged builds and atomic uploads is
available in <<fig-staging-example-pom>>.

        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
----

In order to deploy project artifacts to Nexus with the above setup you
would invoke a build with

----
mvn clean deploy
----

The build will locally stage the artifacts for deployment in
`target/nexus-staging`, on the console and create a closed staging repository in Nexus
holding the build artifacts. This execution of the `deploy`
goal of the Nexus Staging Maven Plugin performs the following actions:

- the artifacts are staged locally, 

- a staging profile is selected either implicitly or explicitly

- a staging repository is either created on the fly if needed or just
  selected

- an atomic upload to the staging repository is performed

- and the staging repository is closed (or dropped if upload fails)

The log of a successful deployment would look similar to this:

If the configuration parameter
`skipStagingRepositoryClose` set to `true` is passed to the plugin
execution, the remote staging repository will not be closed.

Instead of Nexus creating a staging repository based on the implicit
or explicit staging profile selection, you can explicitly configure
the staging repository to use by providing the staging repository name
as value of the `stagingRepositoryId` configuration property via the
plugin configuration or command line invocation. 

The identifier of a staging repository can be determined by looking at
the name column in the list of staging repositories. The name column
used the capitalized id and adds the username and address the staging
was deployed from in brackets. For example a name could be 
`Test-003 (u: admin, a: 127.0.0.1)`. The ID of this staging repository
is `test-003`.

Together with skipping the closing of the repository using
`skipStagingRepositoryClose` it is possible to get multiple builds to
deploy to the same staging repository and therefore have a number of
artifacts go through the staging workflow together. An alternative to
this approach would be to create an aggregating project that assembles
all artifacts together e.g. in an assembly and then use this project
for staging.


Finally to override all staging you can define the full repository URL to
deploy to with the `deployUrl` configuration parameter e.g.

---- 
http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/releases/`.
----

This would cause any staging to be skipped and a straight upload of
the artifacts to the repository to occur.

As part of the configuration section for the plugin you can define
tags with arbitrary key and value names. For example you could create
a tag with key localUsername and a value of the current user picked up
from the USER environment variable:

----
...
<configuration>
...  
  <tags>
    <localUsername>${env.USER}</localUsername>
    <javaVersion>${java.version}</javaVersion>
  </tags>
...
----


Once artifacts are released these tags are transformed into attributes
stored along the artifacts in the release repository and  can be
accessed via the REST interface and therefore any plugin and user
interface integration. 

In addition to the above documented configuration options that
determine the behvaiour of the Nexus Staging Maven Plugin, further
configuration can be provided with the following parameters:

altStagingDirectory:: defaulting to target/nexus-staging you can
set the property to set a different folder for the local staging 
description:: allows you to provide a description for the staging
repository action like close or drop carried out as part of the plugin
execution. The description will then be used in any notification just
like a description provided in the user interface.
keepStagingRepositoryOnFailure:: setting this flag to true will cause
the plugin to skip any clean up operations like dropping a staging
repository for failed uploads, by default these clean up operations
occur
skipStaging:: set to false by default this flag will cause to skip any
execution of the plugin when set to true
skipRemoteStaging:: if this flag is set to true any step related to
remote staging will be skipped and only local staging will be
performed, the default setting is false

With `skipRemoteStaging` set to true, only the local staging
happens. This local staging can then be picked up for the remote
staging and closing by running the `deploy-staged` goal of the plugin
explicitly like this

----
mvn nexus-staging:deploy-staged
----

Besides the default `deploy` goal the Nexus Staging Maven Plugin
supports a number of additional goals. By configuring executions of
the goals as part of your POM or manually invoking them further
automation of a staged release process can be achieved.

deploy-staged:: perform full staging deployment workflow for a locally
staged project e.g. with the artifacts in target/nexus-staging

close:: close the staging repository for current context

drop:: drop the staging repository for current context

release:: release the staging repository for current context

promote:: promote the staging repository for the current context

Closing, dropping and releasing the staging repository using the goals
relies on content of a local staging folder .

Promoting additionally needs the build promotion profile name passed in
via the `buildPromotionProfileId` configuration parameter.

While the above goals need the context of a project with configuration
for the Nexus Staging Plugin in the POM file, it is possible to
execute staging repository related tasks without a project as
well. The Nexus Staging Maven Plugin offers remote-control goals to
control staging in Nexus:

rc-close:: close a specified staging repository 

rc-drop:: drop a specified staging repository 

rc-release:: release a specified staging repository 

rc-promote:: promote a specified staging repository

When invoking these goals outside a project context you need to have
the Nexus Staging Maven Plugin groupId specified as a pluginGroup in
your settings.xml:

----
 <pluginGroups>
       <pluginGroup>org.sonatype.plugins</pluginGroup>
 </pluginGroups>
----

In addition you need to specify all parameters on the command line as
properties passed in via `-Dkey=value`.

At a minimum the required parameters `serverId` and `nexusUrl` have to
be specified:
----
 mvn nexus-staging:rc-close -DserverId=local-nexus -DnexusUrl=http://localhost:8081/nexus
---- 

Depending on the goal you will have to configure the staging
repositories you want to close, drop or release with

----
 -DstagingRepositoryId=repo-001,repo-002
----

and you can also supply a description like this

----
-Ddescription="Dropping since QA of issue 123 failed"
----

For promoting you need to add the required parameter that specifies
the build promotion profile identifier:

----
-DbuildPromotionProfileId=12a25eabf8c8b3f2
----

A successful remote control drop would be logged in the command line
similar to this

---- 
— nexus-staging-maven-plugin:1.2:rc-drop (default-cli) @ standalone-pom —
[INFO] Connecting to Nexus...
[INFO] Using server credentials with ID="nexus-releases" from Maven settings.

----

WARNING: The Nexus Maven Plugin in versions earlier than 2.1.0 had goals
to work with staging repositories. These goals have been deprecated in
favour of the remote control goals of the Nexus Staging Maven Plugin.

[[staging-sect-deployment-nexus-staging-ant-tasks]]
==== Deployment with the Nexus Staging Ant Tasks

The Nexus Staging Ant Tasks provide equivalent features to the Nexus
Staging Maven Plugin for Apache Ant users covering all use cases for
interacting with the Nexus Staging Suite.

To use the Ant tasks in your Ant build file you need to download the
complete jar with the included dependencies. You can find it at
the Central Repository. Simply search for 'nexus-staging-ant-tasks'
and download the jar file with the `uber` classifier
e.g. `nexus-staging-ant-tasks-1.0-uber.jar`.

After downloading, put the jar file somewhere in your
project or in your system so you can add it to the classpath in your
build file with a task definition. In the following example the jar
file is placed in a `tasks` folder within the project.

----
<taskdef uri="antlib:org.sonatype.nexus.ant.staging" 
         resource="org/sonatype/nexus/ant/staging/antlib.xml">
  <classpath>
    <fileset dir="tasks" includes="nexus-staging-ant-tasks-*uber.jar" />
  </classpath>
</taskdef>
----

The deployment related information for your project is captured in a
`nexusStagingInfo` section in your build file that contains all the
necessary configuration.

----
<staging:nexusStagingInfo id="target-nexus" 
    stagingDirectory="target/local-staging">
  <staging:projectInfo groupId="org.sonatype.nexus.ant"
      artifactId="nexus-staging-ant-tasks"
      version="1.0" />
  <staging:connectionInfo 
      baseUrl="http://localhost:8081/nexus">
    <staging:authentication 
      username="deployment" 
      password="deployment123" />
  </staging:connectionInfo>
</staging:nexusStagingInfo>
----

nexusStagingInfo:id:: the identifier that allows you to reference the
staging information in the Ant build file

stagingInfo:stagingDirectory:: the local staging directory, a place
where local staging will happen. Ensure that this directory is cleaned
up by "clean" tasks (or alike, if any).

projectInfo:: the project information targetting a staging
profile. This can be done explicitly with the stagingProfileId or
implicitly with groupId, artifactId and version. stagingRepositoryId
can also be part of projectInfo identifying a staging repository for
interaction

connectionInfo:baseUrl:: the base URL of the Nexus server you want to
deploy to and interact with

If necessary the connection Info can have a nested proxy section

----
<staging:proxy 
    host="proxy.mycorp.com" 
    port="8080">
  <staging:authentication 
      username="proxyUser" 
      password="proxySecret" />
</staging:proxy>
----

With the above setup you are ready to add a deploy target to your
build file that stages the artifacts locally as well as remotely and
closes the staging repository. 

----
<target name="deploy" description="Deploy: Local and Remote Staging">

  <staging:stageLocally>
    <staging:nexusStagingInfo 
        refid="target-nexus" />
      <fileset dir="target/local-repo" 
        includes="**/*.*" />
    </staging:stageLocally>

  <staging:stageRemotely>
    <staging:nexusStagingInfo 
        refid="target-nexus" />
  </staging:stageRemotely>

</target>
----

Similarily you can create a target that releases the staged artifacts
by adding the closeStagingRepository task to the end of the target:

----
<staging:releaseStagingRepository>
  <staging:nexusStagingInfo 
      refid="target-nexus" />
</staging:releaseStagingRepository>
----

The stageLocally task takes a fileset as configuration. The
stageRemotely task has additional configuration options 

keepStagingRepositoryOnFailure:: set to true this causes the remote
staging repository to be kept rather than deleted in case of a failed
upload, default setting is false

skipStagingRepositoryClose:: by default a staging repository is
automatically closed, setting this parameter to true will cause the
staging repository to remain open

In addition to the tasks for local and remote staging the Nexus
Staging Ant Tasks includes tasks for closing, dropping, releasing and
promoting a staging repository:

- closeStagingRepository

- dropStagingRepository

- releaseStagingRepository

- promoteStagingRepository

All these tasks take the context information from the local staging
directory or from the optional parameter `stagingRepositoryId`. The
task to promote a repository has the additional, mandatory attribute
`buildPromotionProfileId` to specify the build promotion profile to
promote.


[[staging-sect-deployment-maven-deploy-plugin]]
==== Deployment with the Maven Deploy Plugin

When using the Maven Deploy Plugin with the Nexus Staging Suite, you
rely on implicit matching of the artifacts against a staging profile
based on a repository target definition. 

To deploy a staged release, a developer needs to deploy to the
staging URL. To configure a project to deploy to the Staging URL, add
the a distributionManagement element to your project's POM. 

[[ex-staging-dist-management]]
.Listing the Staging URL in distributionManagement
----
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" 
...
  <distributionManagement>
    <repository>
      <id>nexus</id>
      <name>Nexus Staging Repo</name>
      <url>http://localhost:8081/nexus/service/local/staging/deploy/maven2/</url>
    </repository>
  </distributionManagement>
...
</project>
----

This configuration element, distributionManagement, defines the
repository to which our deployment will be made. It references the
Staging Suite's Staging URL:
http://localhost:8081/nexus/service/local/staging/deploy/maven2

This URL acts as a something of a virtual repository to be published
to.  If an artifact being published matches one of the Repository
Targets in a Staging Profile, that Staging Profile is "activated" and
a temporary Staging Repository is created.

Once the sample project's distributionManagement has been set
to point at the Nexus Staging URL and your deployment credentials are
updated in your ~/.m2/settings.xml file, you can deploy to the Staging
URL. To do this, run mvn deploy

----

If the Staging Suite is configured correctly, any deployment to the
staging URL matching in a repository target configured for a stating
profile should be intercepted by the Staging Suite and placed in a
temporary staging repository. Deployment with the Maven Deploy Plugin
will not automatically close the staging repository. Closing the
staging repository has to be done with the Nexus user interface or the
Nexus Staging Maven Plugin.  Once this repository has been closed, it
will be made available in the Target Group you selected when you
configured the Staging Profile.


[[staging-sect-deployment-manual]]
==== Manually Uploading a Staged Deployment in Nexus

You can also upload a staged deployment via the Nexus interface. To
upload a staged deployment, select Staging Upload from the Nexus
menu. Clicking Staging Upload will show the panel shown in
<<fig-staging-artifact-upload>>.

[[fig-staging-artifact-upload]]
.Uploading a Staged Deployment in Nexus
image::figs/web/staging_artifact-upload.png[scale=60]

To upload an artifact, click on Select Artifact(s) for Upload... and
select an artifacts from the filesystem to upload. Once you have
selected an artifact, you can modify the classifier and the extension
before clicking on the Add Artifact button. Repeat this process to
upload mutltiple artifacts for the same Group, Artficat and Version
(GAV) coordinates like a jar, the pom and maybe a sources and javadoc
jar in addition. Once you have added all the artifacts, you can then
configure the source of the Group, Artifact, Version (GAV) parameters.

If the artifact you are uploading is a JAR file that was created by
Maven it will already have POM information embedded in it, but if you
are uploading a JAR from a vendor you will likely need to set the
Group Identifier, Artifact Identifier, and Version manually. To do
this, select GAV Parameters from the GAV Definition drop-down at the
top of this form.  Selecting GAV Parameters will expose a set of form
fields which will let you set the Group, Artifact, Version, and
Packaging of the artifacts being uploaded. If you would prefer to set
the Group, Artifact, and Version from a POM file which was associated
with the uploaded artifact, select From POM in the GAV Definition
drop-down. Selecting From POM in this drop-down will expose a button
labelled "Select POM to Upload". Once a POM file has been selected for
upload, the name of the POM file will be displayed in the form field
below this button.

The Staging Upload panel supports multiple artifacts with the same
Group, Artifact, and Version identifiers. For example, if you need to
upload multiple artifacts with different classifiers, you may do so by
clicking on Select Artifact(s) for Upload and Add Artifact multiple
times.  This interface also accepts an Artifact Bundle which is a JAR
that contains more than one artifact, which is documented in more
detail in <<bundles>>.

Once a staging artifact upload has been completely configured, click
on Upload Artifact(s) button to begin the upload process. Nexus will
upload the artifacts to the Staging URL which will trigger any staging
profiles that are activated by the upload by explicity matching using
the repository targets configured with the staging profiles. If a
staging profile is activated, a new staging repository will be created
and can be managed using the procedures outlined in
<<staging-sect-managing-staging>>.


[[staging-sect-managing-staging]]
=== Managing Staging Repositories in Nexus

Once you completed the process outlined in <<staging-sect-deployment>>,
you will have an automatically generated Staging Repository. In
this section, you will walk through the process of managing staging
repositories. Once a staging repository has been created, there are
two steps in the lifecycle of a staging repository. Once you have
deployed a set of related artifacts, you must "Close" the repository
moving it from an "Open" to a "Closed" state. Once a repository is in
the "Closed" state it is added to a Repository Group and is made
available for testing purposes. Once testing is completed, a Nexus
administrator can either Promote or Drop a Closed repository. 

If the repository is Dropped, the repository is discarded and removed
from the Repository Group. If the repository is Promoted, the Nexus
administrator can select a Hosted repository and publish the contents
of the temporary staging repository to a Hosted repository.

[[staging-sect-closing]]
==== Closing an Open Repository

Once you deploy an artifact that triggers a staging
profile, Nexus Staging Suite will create a repository that contains the
artifacts you deployed. A separate staging repository is created for
every combination of User ID, IP Address, and User Agent. This means
that you can perform more than one deployment to a single Staging
Repository as long as you perform the deployment from the same IP, with
the same deployment user, and the same installation of Maven. 

You can perform multiple deployments to an "Open" staging repository,
to see a list of these temporary "Open" Staging repositories, select
"Staging" from the Nexus menu and click on the appropriate Staging
Profile to browse a list of staging repositories which correspond to a
staging profile.

.Listing Repositories Associated with a Staging Profile
image::figs/web/staging_close-repository.png[scale=60]

Once you are ready to start testing the staging repository, you
will need to transition the staging repository from the "Open" state to
the "Closed" state. This will close the temporary staging repository to
more deployments. 

To close a repository, right-click on the repository in the Staging
Repositories panel and select "Close". This will bring up the
following dialog for a staging deployer to describe the contents of a
staging repository. This description field can be used to pass
essential information to the person that needs to test a
deployment. 

In <<fig-staging-close-description>>, the description field is used to
describe the release for the user that needs to certify and promote a
release.

[[fig-staging-close-description]]
.Confirmation and Description Dialog for Closing a Staging Repository
image::figs/web/staging_close-confirm.png[scale=60]

Confirming this state transition will close the repository and add
the repository to a repository group. Once a repository has been closed,
it will be listed as "Closed" in the Profile's Repositories tab.

.Closed Repository After Selecting Finish
image::figs/web/staging_closed-repository.png[scale=60]

[[staging-sect-using-repository]]
==== Using the Staging Repository

Once the Staging Repository has been closed, it will automatically be
added to the Repository Group that was specified in the Staging
Profile. <<fig-staging-add-to-group>> shows an instance of a staging
repository appended to the end of a group named "Public Repositories".

This has the effect of making the staged artifacts available to
everyone who is referencing this public group.  Developers who are
referencing this public repository group can now test and interact
with the staged artifacts as if they were published to a Hosted
repository. 

While the artifacts are made available in a repository group, the fact
that they are held in a temporary staging directory gives the
administrator the option of promoting this set of artifacts to a
Hosted repository or dropping this temporary staging repository if
there are problems discovered during the testing and certification
process for a release.

[[fig-staging-add-to-group]]
.Staging Repository Added to the End of a Repository Group
image::figs/web/staging_staged-to-group.png[scale=60]

Once a staging repository is closed, you can also browse and
search the repository. To view Staging Repositories, click on Browse
Repositories and then select Nexus Managed Repositories as shown in
<<fig-staging-selecting-nexus>>.

[[fig-staging-selecting-nexus]]
.Viewing Nexus Managed Repositories
image::figs/web/staging_select-nexus-managed.png[scale=60]

Once you've selected Nexus Managed Repositories, Nexus will then
show you all of the repositories that have been created by the Nexus
Staging Suite. You can select and browse this temporary Staging
Repository as you would any other repository.

.Browsing a Staging Repository
image::figs/web/staging_browsing-staged.png[scale=60]

You can browse the contents of a staging repository from the
Staging Repositories panel. Click on Staging Repositories in the Nexus
menu, click on a Staging Repository to browse the contents and perform
operations a staging repository.

.Browsing Repository via Staging Profiles
image::figs/web/staging_browsing-via-profiles.png[scale=60]

[[staging-sect-releasing]]
==== Releasing a Staging Repository

Once you are finished testing or certifying that the contents of a
Staging Repository are correct, you are ready to either Release or
Drop the Staging Repository. Dropping the Staging Repository will
delete the temporary staging repository from Nexus and remove any
reference to this repository from the groups it was associated with.
Releasing the Staging Repository allows you to publish the contents of
this temporary repository to a Hosted repository.

To release a Staging Repository select Staging from the Nexus menu
and then click on the appropriate Staging Profile. This will display a
list of Staging Repositories associated with that Staging Profile. To
release the contents of a repository, load the list of Staging
Repositories, check the box next to the staging repository you which to
promote and then click the Release button shown in <<fig-staging-promote>>.

[[fig-staging-promote]]
.Promoting a Staging Repository
image::figs/web/staging_promote-repository.png[scale=60]

Once you click Release, the Nexus Staging Suite will ask you to supply
a description for this release action.

.Selecting the Destination Repository for Staged Repository Promotion
image::figs/web/staging_promote-confirm.png[scale=60]

Supplying a description and clicking on Release will publish the
contents of a Staging Repository to a Hosted repository and delete the
Staging Repository from Nexus.

.Confirmation Dialog for Repository Promotion
image::figs/web/staging_success-promote.png[scale=60]

[[staging-sect-promoting]]
==== Promoting a Staging Repository

If you have a staging repository that you want to promote to a
Build Promotion profile, open the list of Staging Repositories by
selecting Staging Repositories from the Nexus menu, select the
repository you intend to promote, and click the Promote button as shown
in <<fig-staging-promote-button>>.

[[fig-staging-promote-button]]
.Promoting a Staging Repository
image::figs/web/staging_promote-to-group-button.png[scale=60]

After clicking the Promote button the Promote Staging Repository shown
in <<fig-staging-promote-stating>> will be displayed. In this dialog,
you can choose the Build Promotion profile to promote the staging
repository to, and you can supply a short description of the
promotion. Clicking on the Promote button in this dialog will promote
the staging profile to a build promotion profile and expose the
contents of the selected staging repository through a group associated
with the build promotion profile.

[[fig-staging-promote-stating]]
.Multi-level Staging and Build Promotion
image::figs/web/staging_promote-to-group.png[scale=60]

After you promote a staging repository to a Build Promotion
profile the build promotion profile will create a temporary repository
which contains the contents of the promoted staging repository. The
staging repository will be a Group Member of the Build Promotion
repository. One or more staging repositories can be promoted to a
single Build Promotion profile, and you can browse the Group Member by
selecting the Build Promotion repository and viewing the Group Member
tab as shown in <<fig-staging-group-members>>.

[[fig-staging-group-members]]
.Multi-level Staging and Build Promotion
image::figs/web/staging_browse-group-members.png[scale=60]

[[staging-sect-using-build]]
==== Releasing, Promoting, and Dropping Build Promotion Profiles

When you configure a Build Promotion profile and promote Staging
Repositories to promotion profiles, each Build Promotion profile creates
a repository which contains one or more Staging Repositories. Just like
you can promote the contents of a Staging Repository to a Build
Promotion profile, you can also promote the contents of a Build
Promotion profile to another Build Promotion profile. When you do this
you can create hierarchies of staging repositories and build promotion
profiles which can then be dropped or released together.

[[fig-staging-build-promo-agg]]
.Releasing, Promoting, and Dropping Build Promotion Profiles
image::figs/web/staging-promotion.png[scale=60]

When you promote a staging repository to a build promotion
profile, you make the contents of a staging repository available via a
repository group associated with a build promotion profile. 


For example, if you staged a few artifacts to a QA Staging Repository
and then subsequently promoted that repository to a Closed Beta Build
Promotion group, the contents of the QA Staging Repository would
initially be made available via a QA Repository Group. After a build
promotion, these artifacts would also be available via a Closed Beta
repository group.  

You can take it one step further and promote the contents of the
Closed Beta Build Promotion profile to yet another Build Promotion
profile. In this way you can have an arbitrary number of intermediate
steps between the initial staging deployment and the final release.

If you drop the contents of a build promotion profile, you roll back
to the previous state. For example, if you decided to drop the
contents of the Closed Beta build promotion group, Nexus will revert
the status of the Staging Repository from promoted to closed, and make
the artifacts available via the QA Staging Repository. The effects of
promoting, dropping, and releasing artifacts through a series of
Staging Profiles and Build Promotion Profiles is shown in
<<fig-staging-build-promo-agg>>.

When you perform a release on a Build Promotion profile, each Staging
Repository is going to release artifacts to the Release Repository
configured in <<fig-staging-edit-profile>>.  Because a Build
Repository can contain one or more promoted staging repositories, this
means that releasing a Build Promotion profile can cause artifacts to
be published to more than one Release Repository.  Build Promotion
profiles are not directly related to release repositories, only
staging profiles are directly associated with target release
repositories. <<fig-staging-multi-to-one>> illustrates this behaviour
with two independent Staging Repositories each configured with a
separate Release Repository. Releasing the Build Promotion profile
causes Nexus to publish each Staging Repository to a separate hosted
repository.

[[fig-staging-multi-to-one]]
.Promoting Multiple Repositories to the Same Build Promotion Profile
image::figs/web/multiple-promotion-release.png[scale=60]




[[staging-sect-multi]]
==== Multi-level Staging and Build Promotion

Nexus also supports multi-level staging and build
promotion. With multi-level staging, a staging repository can be
tested and then promoted to a separate "build promotion" profile and
exposed through different repository groups to allow for additional
testing and qualification before a final
frelease. <<fig-staging-multi-scenario>> illustrates a potential use
for multi-level staging:

Stage:: A developer publishes artifacts to a QA staging profile which
exposes the staged artifacts in a QA repository group used by an
internal quality assurance team for testing.

Promote to Beta:: Once the QA team has successfully completed
testing, they promote the temporary staging repository to build
promotion profile which will expose the staged artifacts to a limited
set of customers who have agreed to act as a beta testers for a new
feature.

Release:: Once this closed beta testing period is finished, the
staged repository is then released and the artifacts it contains are
published to a hosted release repository and exposed via the public
repository group.

[[fig-staging-multi-scenario]]
.Multi-level Staging and Build Promotion
image::figs/web/multi-level-staging.png[scale=60]

To support this multi-level staging feature, you can configure Build
Promotion profiles as detailed in
<<staging-sect-config-build-profile>>. Once you have promoted a
Staging Repository to a Build Promotion profile, you can drop,
promote, or release the artifacts it contains as detailed in
<<staging-sect-prepare-nexus>>.


[[staging-sect-rulesets]]
=== Enforcing Standards for Deployment and Promotion with Rulesets

Nexus has the ability to define staging rules that must be satisfied
to allow successful deployment or before a staging repository can be
promoted.

[[staging-sect-staging-rulesets]]
==== Managing Staging Rulesets

Staging Rulesets are groups of rules that are applied to a Staging
repository at promotion time. A staging repository associated with a
staging ruleset cannot be promoted until all of the rules associated
with the rulesets have been satisfied. This feature allows you to set
standards for your own hosted repositories, and it is the mechanism
that is used to guarantee the consistency of artifacts stored in the
Maven Central repository.

Nexus Professional contains the following rules:

Staging Javadoc Validation:: The Staging Javadoc Validation rule will
verify that every project has an artifact with the javadoc
classifier. If you attempt to promote a staging repository which
contains artifacts not accompanied by "-javadoc.jar" artifacts, this
validation rule will fail.

Staging Artifact Uniqueness Validation:: This rule checks to see that
the artifact being released, promoted, or staged is unique in a
particular Nexus instance.

Staging Checksum Validation:: This rule validates file checksums
against published artifacts.

Staging No Release Repository:: This rule will fail if a particular
staging profile is not defined with a release repository.

Staging POM Validation:: The Staging POM Validation rule will verify
Project URL - project/url, Project Licenses - project/licenses and
Project SCM Information - project/scm.  If any of these POM elements
are missing or empty, this Staging Ruleset will cause a promotion to
fail.

Staging Signature Validation:: The Staging Signature Validation rule
verifies that every item in the repository has a valid PGP
signature. If you attempt to promote a staging repository which
contains artifacts not accompanied by valid PGP signature, this
validation will fail.

Staging Sources Validation:: The Staging Sources Validation rule will
verify that every project has an artifact with the sources
classifier. If you attempt to promote a staging repository which
contains artifacts not accompanied by "-sources.jar" artifacts, this
validation rule will fail.

To create a Staging Ruleset, click on the Staging Ruleset link in the
Nexus Menu. This will load the interface shown in
<<fig-staging-rulesets>>.  The Staging Ruleset panel is used to define
sets of rules that can be applied to Staging
Profiles. <<fig-staging-rulesets>> shows a ruleset which contains all
four predefined staging rules.

[[fig-staging-rulesets]]
.Creating a Staging Ruleset
image::figs/web/staging-rulesets.png[scale=60]

[[staging-sect-defining-rulesets]]
==== Defining Rulesets for Promotion

To define a ruleset to be used for promotion, click on Staging in the
Nexus menu and select a Staging Profile. Click on the Configuration
tab, and scroll down to the Promote Repository Staging Rulesets
section of the Staging Profile configuration as shown in
<<fig-staging-associate-ruleset>>. The next time you attempt to
promote a staging repository that was created with this profile, Nexus
Professional will check that all of the rules in the associated
rulesets are being adhered to.
