[[configuration-introduction]]
=== Introduction

This chapter covers all aspects of configuring {pro} and {oss}. Specifically the sections and menu items of the
'Administration' main menu are covered. It can be accessed by authorized users by pressing the 'Administration'
button image:figs/web/ui-admin-button-icon.png[scale=50] in the main toolbar.

TIP: The default user for accessing these features has the username 'admin' and the password 'admin123'. More
fine-grained access can be configured as detailed in <<security>>.

The 'Administration' menu contains the following sections:

'Repository':: The 'Repository' section allows you to manage all 'Repositories' and related configurations such as
'Routing' and 'Targets'.

'IQ Server' ({pro} only):: The 'Server' item allows you to configure the connection of {pro} to {iq}. Further 
documentation is available in the 
http://books.sonatype.com/sonatype-clm-book/html/book/nexus-repository.html[{iq} documentation].

NOTE: If you desire to utilize Nexus Firewall to quarantine and block unacceptable components that may harm your
repository manager, review the 
https://books.sonatype.com/sonatype-clm-book/html/book/quick-start-fw.html[quick start guide]. Firewall is only 
available to {pro} users.

'Security':: This section provides access to all the configuration features related to authentication and
authorization of users including 'Privileges', 'Roles', 'Users', but also 'LDAP', 'Atlassian Crowd', 'SSL
Certificates' and 'User Token'.

'Support':: Access a number of features that allow you to administer and monitor your repository manager
successfully like 'Logging' and 'System Information'.

'System':: The <<system, general configuration>> for getting started and running the repository manager
with e.g., <<admin-system-http, 'HTTP'>> or <<admin-system-emailserver,'Email Server'>> settings, but also
<<admin-system-capabilities,'Capabilities'>> and <<admin-system-tasks,'Tasks'>> to run regularly and other
configurations.

[[getting-started]]
=== Getting Started

tbd ... write about what to do when first getting going, some system config and some repo config probably, take from
other section in book and training..

this should link to the various sections
////

[[system]]
=== System Configuration

The 'System' section of the 'Administration' menu gives you access to a number of configuration features that you
typically need to configure, after successful installation. The following sections detail:

* Access information about used <<admin-system-bundles,Bundles>>
* Advanced configuration with <<admin-system-capabilities,Capabilities>>
* <<admin-system-emailserver,Email/SMTP server configuration>>
* Accessing <<nodes,Nodes>> for active-active high availability
* <<admin-system-http,HTTP/HTTPS proxy server configuration>>
* Setting a <<admin-base-url,Base URL>> for an application
* Setting a <<admin-base-url,Base URL>> for the repository manager
* Configuration and management of automated maintenance <<admin-system-tasks,Tasks>>

[[admin-system-bundles]]
==== Bundles
{inall}

The {nxrm} application runs on the OSGi container http://felix.apache.org/[Apache Felix]. All features and plugins
are managed by the container and are implemented as OSGi bundles.

The 'Bundles' feature view is available in the 'System' section of the 'Administration' main menu. It allows you
to inspect a list of all the OSGi bundles that are deployed as part of the application and access detailed
information about each bundle.

TIP: Find out more about OSGi and OSGi bundles on the http://www.osgi.org/[website of the OSGi Alliance].

[[admin-system-capabilities]]
==== Accessing and Configuring Capabilities
{inall}

Capabilities are features of the repository manager and plugins that can be configured by a user in a generic
administration feature view accessible in the 'System' section of the 'Administration' main menu via
'Capabilities'.

The repository manager ships with a number of capabilities preinstalled and allows you to enable/disable them.
An example capability is 'Outreach: Management' displayed in <<fig-capability-outreach>>.

[[fig-capability-outreach]]
.Outreach: Management Capability Settings
image::figs/web/capability-outreach.png[scale=75]

The list of capabilities can be filtered with the search input box in the header of the list and sorted by the
different columns by pressing a column header. The list uses the following columns:

State:: The state column does not have a title. Enabled capabilities have a green checkmark added on top of a blue
icon. Disabled capabilities use a greyed out icon.

Type:: The 'Type' column provides the specific type of a capability in the list.

Category:: The 'Category' is optional and details the wider context the capability belongs to.

Description:: The 'Description' column contains further descriptive information about the capability.

Notes:: The 'Notes' column can contain user created text about the capability.

Every capability can be inspected and configured by selecting it in the list. The resulting view display the
'Summary' view of the specific capability. This view includes the display of 'Type', 'State' and optionally
'Category' and 'Description' in the 'Summary' section as well as further information in the 'Status', 'About' and
'Notes' sections.  The 'Status' section displays a text message that details the status of the capability and any
potential problems with the configuration.  Depending on the capability, the reasons can vary widely.  The 'About'
section displays a descriptive text about the purpose of the capability.  The 'Notes' field can be used to 
provide a descriptive text about the capability or any other notes related to it and can be persisted by pressing 
the 'Save' button.

The 'Delete' button below the title allows you to remove a capability and it's configuration entirely. The
'Enable' and 'Disable' buttons on the other hand can be used to switch the state of the capability.

The 'Settings' view allows you to activate or deactivate the capability with the 'Enable this capability'
checkbox. Below this checkbox, each capability type has specific additional configuration parameters
available. Once you have completed the configuration, press the 'Save' button.

The capabilities management feature view supports adding new capabilities by pressing the 'Create capability'
button above the list and selecting the desired capability 'Type' from the list. The next view allows you to
perform any capability-specific configuration and finish the process by pressing the 'Create capability' button
below the parameters.

Many of the built-in capabilities and plugins can be configured in the 'Capabilities' administration section but
also in other more user friendly, targeted user interface sections, e.g., the user token feature of {pro} can be
administrated by using the interface available via the 'User Token' menu item in the 'Security' section of the
'Administration' menu as well as by editing the user token capability. Other capabilities are internal
functionality and sometimes managed automatically by the responsible plugin. Some optional configuration like the
branding plugin or advanced features of the smart proxy configuration are only done in the capabilities
administration.

Usage of specific capabilities to achieve a variety of tasks is detailed in parts of the documentation.

WARNING: In many cases you will not need to configure anything in 'Capabilities' unless explicitly instructed to
do so by the support team. Execute any capability changes with caution, potentially backing up your configuration
before proceeding.

[[admin-system-emailserver]]
==== Email Server
{inall}

The repository manager may send out email messages for a number of reasons. In order for these messages to be
delivered, you need to configure the connection to the SMTP server under the 'Email Server' menu item in the
'System' section of the 'Administration' menu as displayed in <<fig-config-administration-smtp>>.

[[fig-config-administration-smtp]]
.Email Server Configuration
image::figs/web/admin-system-emailserver.png[scale=60]

The following configuration options are available:

Enabled:: Determines whether email sending is activated or not, independent of a server being configured.

Host and Port:: The name of the host and the port to use to connect to the SMTP server.

Use the Nexus truststore:: This checkbox allows you to configure the repository manager to use its certificate
truststore. You can also view and import the certificate from the email server. Further details are documented in
<<ssl>>.

Username and Password:: The credentials of the user of the SMTP server to use for authentication.

From address:: This parameter defines the email address used in the +From:+ header of any email sent by the
repository manager. Typically, this is configured as a "Do-Not-Reply" email address or a mailbox or mailing list
monitored by the administrators of the repository manager.

Subject prefix:: This parameter allows you to define a prefix used in the subject line of all emails sent by the
repository manager. This allows the recipients to set up automatic filtering and sorting easily. An example is
`[Nexus Notification]`.

SSL/TLS options:: These options can be used to configure usage of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) when emails are sent by the repository manager using SMTP. These options include the ability
to use STARTTLS, which upgrades the initially established, plain connection to be encrypted when sending
emails. The following options are available to you:

Enable STARTTLS support for insecure connections;; This checkbox allows you to enable support for upgrading
insecure connections using STARTTLS.

Require STARTTLS support;; This checkbox requires that insecure connections are upgraded using STARTTLS. If this
is not supported by the SMTP server, no emails are sent.

Enable SSL/TLS encryption upon connection;; This checkbox enables SSL/TLS encryption for the transport on
connection using SMTPS/POPS.

Enable server identity check;; This option verifies the server certificate when using TLS or SSL, following the
RFC 2595 specification.

Once you have configured the parameters you can use the 'Verify email server' button to confirm the configured
parameters and the successful connection to the server. You are asked to provide an email address that should
receive a test email message. Successful sending is confirmed in a message.

[[nodes]]
==== Nodes

The 'Nodes' screen provides a summary of all active nodes. The screen keeps a record of all running nodes that you
can manage for single or multiple deployments of nodes, in table form. To view the status of your active node
click 'Nodes' in the 'Administration' menu under 'System'. When you click a row, you get a detailed summary of the
chosen node.

The summary lists:

* 'Node Identity', a unique ID accessible via the 'System Information'
* 'Local', 'true' for the server you're currently accessing
* 'Socket Address', the address corresponding to the server

If you run multiple nodes the 'Nodes' screen displays all synchronized nodes in the table. The client you use to
view your local node (e.g. browser) will be listed as 'true'. View the table to monitor and verify server 
connections.

Also, from the 'Nodes' screen you can protect your server's database from write access by activating read-only
mode. This allows you to avoid modifications to your server configuration and blob stores when performing system
maintenance. To enable it:

1. Click 'Nodes', under 'System'  in the 'Administration' menu
2. Click 'Enable read-only mode'

WARNING: Anything that would require a change to a database will fail during read-only mode.

The button becomes 'Disable read-only mode' when enabled. A banner appears above the main toolbar, notifying you that
read-only mode is activated.

Disabling read-only mode, by clicking the 'Disable read-only mode' button returns the server to its original,
writable state.

////
Uncomment for HA(3.4?) release
NOTE: If you enabled high availabilty and run multiple nodes in a cluster, all nodes will be affected by read-only
mode. To reinstate the nodes for write access, disable read-only mode.
////

[[admin-base-url]]
==== Base URL Creation

The 'Base URL' is the address end users apply when navigating to the user interface. The repository manager
only uses this value to construct absolute URLs to your user interface inside of email notifications.

The most common reason why the address would be different is if you have a reverse proxy that terminates
HTTP requests at an address different from where the repository manager is running.

To set the Base URL:

* Go to the 'System' section of the 'Administration' menu and select 'Capabilities'.
* Search for an existing 'Base URL' capability and select it if it exists or click the 'Create capability'
button and choose 'Base URL' from the 'Select Capability Type' list.
* Enter a new URL value.
* Press the 'Create capability' to add the 'Base URL'.

[[admin-system-http]]
==== HTTP and HTTPS Request and Proxy Settings
{inall}

The repository manager uses HTTP requests to fetch content from remote servers. In some cases a customization of
these requests is required. Many organizations use proxy servers for any outbound HTTP network traffic. The
connection to these proxy servers from the repository manager needs to be configured to allow it to reach remote
repositories. All this can be configured in the 'HTTP' configuration available via the 'System' section of the
'Administration' menu and displayed in <<fig-admin-system-http>>.

[[fig-admin-system-http]]
.Configuring HTTP Request Settings
image::figs/web/admin-system-http.png[scale=50]

User-agent customization:: The HTTP configuration in 'User-agent customization' allows you to append a string to
the +User-Agent+ HTTP header field. This can be a required customization by your proxy servers.

Connection/Socket timeout and attempts:: The amount of time in seconds the repository manager waits for a request
to succeed when interacting with an external, remote repository as well as the number of retry attempts to make
when requests fail can be configured with these settings.

If your repository manager instance needs to reach public repositories like the Central Repository via a proxy
server, you can configure the connection to a proxy server. Typically such an internal proxy server proxies HTTP
as well as HTTPS connections to external repositories. In this case you configure a HTTP proxy. Select the
checkbox beside 'HTTP Proxy' and configure the parameters in the sections displayed in
<<fig-admin-system-http-proxy>>. If your organization uses a separate, additional proxy server for HTTPS
connections, you have to configure it in the 'HTTPS Proxy' section.

TIP: This is a critical initial step for many Enterprise deployments of {pro} and {oss}, since these environments
are typically secured via an HTTP/HTTPS proxy server for all outgoing internet traffic.

[[fig-admin-system-http-proxy]]
.Configuring HTTP Proxy Settings
image::figs/web/admin-system-http-proxy.png[scale=50]

You can specify the 'HTTP proxy host' and the 'HTTP proxy port' of the HTTP or HTTPS proxy server and, 
optionally, the 'Authentication' details for 'Username' and 'Password'. If a Windows NT LAN Manager is used to 
authenticate with the proxy server you can configure the needed connection details in 'Windows NTLM hostname' and 
'Windows NTLM domain'.

In addition, you can configure a number of hosts that the repository manager reaches directly, ignoring the proxy
settings. Requests to them should not go through the configured HTTP/HTTPS proxy. These hosts can be configured 
in the 'Hosts to exclude from HTTP/HTTPS proxy' setting. You can add a hostname in the input box and add it with 
the `+` button. The `*` character can be used for wildcard matching for numerous host names allowing a setting 
such as `*.example.com`. Entries can be removed with the `x` button.

<<fig-admin-system-http-proxy>> shows the 'HTTP Proxy' administration interface. The HTTPS configuration 
interface looks the same and is found below the HTTP configuration.

[[admin-system-tasks]]
==== Configuring and Executing Tasks
{inall}

The repository manager allows you to schedule the execution of maintenance tasks. The tasks can carry out regular
maintenance steps that will be applied to all repositories or to specific repositories on a configurable schedule
or simply perform other system maintenance. Use the 'Tasks' menu item in the 'System' section of the
'Administration' menu to access the feature view, shown in <<fig-repomap-scheduled>>, that allows you to manage
your 'Tasks'.

[[fig-repomap-scheduled]]
.Managing Tasks
image::figs/web/tasks.png[scale=50]

The list interface allows you to add new tasks with the 'Create task' button as well as inspect and work with the
configured tasks. The list shows the following columns:

Name:: A user-defined name for the task to identify it in the user interface and log files.

Type:: The type of action the scheduled task executes. The list of available task types is documented in more
detail below.

Status:: Tasks can either be 'Waiting' for their next run, currently 'Running' or 'Disabled'.

Schedule:: The 'Schedule' column shows the 'Task frequency' e.g., 'Daily', 'Monthly', 'Manual' and others.

Next run:: This column displays date and time of the next execution of the task based on the configured schedule.

Last run and Last result:: These columns display the date and time as well as the result and duration of the last
execution of the specific task.

When creating or updating a scheduled task, you can configure the following additional properties:

Task enabled:: Enable or disable a specific task with the checkbox.

Notification Email:: Configure a notification email for task execution failures. If a scheduled task fails a
notification email containing the task identifier and name as well as the stack trace of the failure will be sent
to the configured email recipient.

Task frequency:: Selecting the task frequency allows you to configure the schedule for the task
executions. Available choices are 'Manual', 'Once', 'Hourly', 'Daily', 'Weekly', 'Monthly' and 'Advanced (provide
a CRON expression)'. Apart from 'Manual', all choices trigger display of a custom user interface for scheduling
the specific recurrence. Tasks scheduled to one 'Once' will be removed by the system after they run. Weekly 
scheduling requires at least one day of the week to be selected. The advanced setting requires you to provide a 
CRON expression to configure more complex schedules. 

The syntax used for 'Advanced (provide a CRON expression)' follows the UNIX-style CRON syntax. CRON expressions
are comprised of 6 required fields and one optional field separated by white space as described in
<<tbl-tasks-cron>> and the following paragraphs. A simple expression example is `0 0 9 * * ?`. This configuration
triggers a task execution every day at 9:00 in the morning. Further examples are available in
<<tbl-cron-examples>>.

[[tbl-tasks-cron]]
.Fields of a CRON Expression from Left to Right
[width="100%",options="header"]
|=========
| Field Name | Allowed Values | Allowed Special Characters
| Seconds    | 0-59 | `, - * /`
| Minutes	 | 0-59	| `, - * /`
| Hours	 	 | 0-23	| `, - * /`
| Day-of-month | 1-31 |	 `, - * ? / L W`
| Month	 	   | 1-12 or JAN-DEC |  `, - * /`
| Day-of-Week  | 1-7 or SUN-SAT	 | 	`, - * ? / L #`
| Year (Optional) | empty, 1970-2099 |	`, - * /`
|=========

The `*` character is used to specify any value. For example, `*` in the minute field means every minute.

The `?` character is allowed for the day-of-month and day-of-week fields. It is used to specify no specific
value. This is useful when you need to specify something in one of the two fields, but not the other.

The `-` character is used to specify ranges. For example `10-12` in the hour field means "the hours 10,11 and 12".

The `,` character is used to specify additional values. For example `MON,WED,FRI` in the day-of-week field means
"the days Monday, Wednesday, and Friday".

The `/` character is used to specify a start value and increments. For example "0/15" in the seconds field means
"the seconds 0, 15, 30, and 45". And "5/15" in the seconds field means "the seconds 5, 20, 35, and 50". Specifying
`*` before the `/` is equivalent to specifying `0` as the value to start with. Essentially, for each field in the
expression, there is a set of numbers that can be turned on or off. For seconds and minutes, the numbers range
from 0 to 59. For hours 0 to 23, for days of the month 0 to 31, and for months 1 to 12. The `/` character simply
helps you turn on every "nth" value in the given set. Thus "7/6" in the month field only turns on month "7", it
does not mean every 6th month, please note that subtlety.

The `L` character is allowed for the day-of-month and day-of-week fields. This character is short-hand for "last",
but it has different meaning in each of the two fields. For example, the value `L` in the day-of-month field means
"the last day of the month" - day 31 for January, day 28 for February on non-leap years. If used in the
day-of-week field by itself, it simply means `7` or `SAT`. But if used in the day-of-week field after another
value, it means "the last xxx day of the month" - for example `6L` means "the last Friday of the month". When
using the L option, it is important not to specify lists, or ranges of values, as you will get confusing results.

The `W` character is allowed for the day-of-month field. This character is used to specify the weekday
(Monday-Friday) nearest the given day. As an example, if you were to specify "15W" as the value for the
day-of-month field, the meaning is: "the nearest weekday to the 15th of the month". So if the 15th is a Saturday,
the trigger will fire on Friday the 14th. If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 16th. If
the 15th is a Tuesday, then it will fire on Tuesday the 15th. However if you specify `1W` as the value for
day-of-month, and the 1st is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 3rd, as it will not jump over the
boundary of a months days. The `W` character can only be specified when the day-of-month is a single day, not a
range or list of days.

The `L` and `W` characters can also be combined for the day-of-month expression to yield `LW`, which translates to
"last weekday of the month".

The `#` character is allowed for the day-of-week field. This character is used to specify "the nth" XXX day of the
month. For example, the value of "6#3" in the day-of-week field means the third Friday of the month (day 6 =
Friday and `#3` is the 3rd one in the month). Other examples: `2#1` is the first Monday of the month and `4#5` is
the fifth Wednesday of the month. Note that if you specify `#5` and there is not 5 of the given day-of-week in the
month, then no firing will occur that month.

The legal characters and the names of months and days of the week are not case sensitive.

|=======

The 'Start date' and 'Start time' allow you to configure a specific date and time from when the schedule should be
activated. The 'Time to run this task' settings is used to configure the actual time of the task execution.

Task-type specific configuration is displayed below the notification email input field and differs for each 
scheduled task.

The following task types are available to perform specific maintenance:

Compact blob store:: Content deleted from a <<admin-repository-blobstores,blob store>> is not physically deleted
from the storage device. Instead it is only internally marked for deletion. This task performs the actual
deletion of the relevant files, and therefore frees up the storage space.

Export configuration & metadata for backup:: This task performs a full back up of the underlying {nxrm} databases, 
including access logs, repository manager configuration, and security configuration. You must choose a location for 
the backup data for this task. When you run the backup, the task adds a timestamp to the backup files that are 
created in the backup data location. It is important to note that this backup only includes the data just listed,
actual repository content is not backed up using this task.

Execute script:: Scripts can be provided in the 'Source' field and have to be written using the Groovy programming
language. These scripts can use the APIs of the repository manager to perform maintenance and other modification
tasks. Please consult the Javadoc and source for further information. 

Publish Maven indexes:: Maven indexes can be used to download an index of available components to a client
including a developer's IDE, for example. The task publishes the index for all or a specific Maven repository.

Purge incomplete docker uploads:: Docker uploads to a repository can be hundreds of MB in size. It is possible to
have incomplete uploads or orphaned files remain in temporary storage as a result of incomplete or interrupted
uploads. The temporary storage consumed by these incomplete or orphaned uploads can be cleaned up with this
task. You can configure the minimum age of incomplete uploads to be purged and have them deleted by the task
execution. In addition, any incomplete uploads from docker that have been orphaned by a repository manager 
restart will be cleaned up whenever the task executes.

Purge orphaned API keys:: This scheduled task deletes old, unused API keys. These keys are generated, for
example, when using the User Token feature or publishing to NuGet repositories. A key becomes unused, when the
user account is deleted. The task purges these orphaned API keys and should be scheduled to run regularly to
remove these redundant keys.

Purge unused components and assets:: This task can be used to remove components and assets in proxy repositories.
Any asset that has not been requested in the configured number of days will be purged.

Purge unused docker manifests and images:: This task will handle purging content that is no longer referenced.
As new manifests are created and associated with a tag, previous manifests will still sit around in the repository 
providing no use.  This also applies to any images that are no longer referenced by a tagged manifest.  V1 layers 
that are no longer referenced by a tagged layer will also be removed.

Purge unused Maven snapshot versions:: This task can be used to remove unused snapshots from Maven repositories. 
Any snapshot that has not been requested in the configured number of days will be purged.

Rebuild Maven repository metadata:: This task rebuilds the +maven-metadata.xml+ files with the correct information
and will also (optionally) validate and fix any incorrect checksums (.md5/.sha1) for all files in the specified maven2
 hosted repository. The 'Group Id', 'Artifact Id' and 'Base Version' parameters allow you to narrow down the section 
 of the repository that will be repaired. Typically this task is run manually to repair a corrupted repository.

Rebuild repository index:: With support for hosted and proxy repositories, this task can rebuild the index. It
inspects actual components and assets found in the repository and rebuilds the index to reflect the true content
for supporting search and browse actions.

Remove Maven indexes:: This task is the counter-part to the task 'Publish Maven indexes' and
can remove the index.

Remove snapshots from Maven repository:: This task can be scheduled to remove SNAPSHOT-versioned components from a
Maven repository. Typically this is useful to preserve storage space, as old SNAPSHOT versions are not accessed
after deployment of a new snapshot and no longer added value.  The tasks removes all metadata about the components
and assets affected, while it does not reclaim disk space used by the binary assets. This can be achieved by
running a 'Compact blob store' task afterwards. When you create a scheduled task to remove snapshots, you can
specify the 'Repository/Group' to affect, as well as:

Minimum snapshot count;; This configuration option allows you to specify a minimum number of snapshots to preserve
per component SNAPSHOT version.  For example, if you configured this option with a value of 2, the repository
manager will always preserve at least two time-stamped SNAPSHOT versions. A value of -1 indicates that all
snapshots should be preserved.

Snapshot retention (days);; This configuration option allows you to specify the number of days to retain 
component SNAPSHOT versions.  For example, if you want to make sure that you are always keeping the last three
day's worth of snapshots, configure this option with a value of 3. The 'Minimum snapshot count' 
configuration overrides this setting.

Remove if released;; If checked, all SNAPSHOT versions that match any released component found with the same
groupId and artifactId coordinates will be removed. For example, if a release version of
'com.example:hello-world:1.0.0' is found, all 'com.example:hello-world:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT' assets are deleted.

Grace period after release (days);; This parameter allows you to specify a number of days before 
released snapshots are purged. If a release associated to a snapshot has an updated timestamp and falls 
within the set grace period, it will not be purged. This setting will give the respective project that references 
the snapshot dependency time to upgrade to the release component or the next snapshot version.

CAUTION: The deletion of Maven snapshots when 'Remove if released' is checked takes precedence over the number 
you select in the 'Minimum snapshot count' field. Also, it is possible to configure the task in such a 
way that the results may be unexpected. For example, if configured to keep 0 minimum snapshots older than 0 days, 
all snapshots everywhere will be deleted, despite whether or not a grace period is configured for releases.

Restore Asset/Component metadata from Blob Store;; This task allows you to recover lost asset/component metadata
from a chosen blob store. The task is useful in cases as where you want to recover lost information from corrupt
OrientDB databases. When executed, the task searches the selected blob store for blobs missing their associated
metadata. The asset/component metadata is restored based on the information contained in the blob store.

NOTE: Currently, 'Restore Asset/Component metadata from Blob Store' only recovers metadata for Maven repositories.

Beyond these tasks any plugin can provide additional scheduled tasks, which will appear once you have installed 
the plugin.

Setting up tasks execution adapted to your usage of the repository manager is an important first step when 
setting up a {nxrm} instance. Go through the list of task types and consider your usage patterns. In 
addition update your tasks when changing your usage. E.g., if you start to regularly deploy snapshots by 
introducing continuous integration server builds with deployment.

Repositories are the containers for the components provided to your users as explained in more detail in
<<concepts>>. Creating and managing repositories is an essential part of your {nxrm} configuration, since
it allows you to expose more components to your users.

It supports proxy repositories, hosted repositories and repository groups using a number of different repository
formats.

The binary parts of a repository are stored in blob stores, which can be configured by selecting 'Blob stores'
from the 'Repository' sub menu of the 'Administration' menu.

To manage repositories select the 'Repositories' item in the 'Repository' sub menu of the 'Administration' menu.

[[admin-repository-blobstores]]
==== Blob Stores

A blob store is a storage mechanism for the binary parts of the components and their assets. Each blob
store can be used by one or multiple repositories and repository groups. A 'default' blob store that is
based on a file system storage within the `data` directory configured during the installation is automatically
configured.

The 'Blob stores' feature view available via the 'Blob stores' item in the 'Repository' sub menu of the
'Administration' menu displays a list of all configured blob stores. The columns provide some detail about each
blob store:

Name:: the name of the blob store as displayed in the repository administration
Type:: the type of the blob store backend, currently only 'File' is available representing a file system-based 
 storage
Blob count:: the number of blobs currently stored
Total size:: the size of the blob store
Available space:: the overall space available for the blob store

Click on a specific row to inspect further details of the selected blob store. The details view displays 'Type'
and 'Name' and the absolute 'Path' to the file system storage.

The 'Create blob store' button allows you to add further blob stores. You can configure the 'Type' and 'Name' for
the blob store. The 'Path' parameter should be an absolute path to the desired file system location. It has to be
fully accessible by the operating system user account running the Nexus repository manager.

Once a blob store has been created it can no longer be modified and any blob store used by a repository or
repository group can not be deleted.

Blobs deleted in a repository are only marked for deletion. The 'Compact blob store' <<admin-system-tasks,task>>
can be used to permanently delete these 'soft-deleted' blobs and therefore free up the used storage space.

[[admin-respository-blobstores-choosing]]
===== Choosing the Number of Blob Stores

You will need to choose how many blob stores to create, and how you allocate repositories to these blob stores.
This decision should be based on:

* the size of your repositories
* the rate at which you expect them to grow over time
* the storage space available to your {nxrm}
* the options you have available for adding storage space

For the time being, once a repository is allocated to a blob store, it is there permanently. Blob stores can be
moved from one storage device to another (e.g. to a larger storage device) using a manual process, but
blob stores cannot be split, nor can repositories span multiple blob stores. For these reasons, your approach to
using blob stores should be chosen carefully.

The simplest approach is to create a single blob store per storage device and divide your repositories among them.
This is suitable if either:

* Your repositories are growing slowly enough that you won't exceed your available storage within a year
* If you exceed available storage, you will be able to move blob stores to larger storage devices.

You should separate repositories into two or more blob stores per storage device if both:

* You expect to exceed your currently available storage within a year
* You cannot move blob stores to larger storage devices, so you must add capacity to {nxrm} by adding additional
storage devices.

The most flexible approach is to create a separate blob store for each repository, although this is not
recommended except in extreme cases of unpredictable capacity because of the administrative complexity.

The current repository-to-blob store limitations will be removed in an upcoming release of {nxrm}, which will make
it possible to revise your repository/blob store approach over time.

[[admin-repository-blobstores-size]]
===== Estimating Blob Store Size

Blob stores contain two files for each binary component stored in {nxrm}:

* The binary component, stored as a .bytes file (whose size is the same as the component)
* A properties file that stores a small amount of metadata for disaster recovery purposes (<1k)

The total storage size of a blob store is therefore approximately the total size of all of your components, plus an
allowance for the properties files and the block size of your storage device. (On average, this will be
1.5 * # of components * block size.)

[[proxy-repository]]
==== Proxy Repository

A repository with the type 'proxy', also known as a proxy repository, is a repository that is linked to a remote
repository. Any request for a component is verified against the local content of the proxy repository. If no local
component is found, the request is forwarded to the remote repository. The component is then retrieved and stored
locally in the repository manager, which acts as a cache. Subsequent requests for the same component are then
fulfilled from the local storage, therefore eliminating the network bandwidth and time overhead of retrieving the
component from the remote repository again.

By default, the repository manager ships with the following configured proxy repositories:

maven-central:: This proxy repository accesses the http://search.maven.org/[Central Repository], formerly known as
Maven Central. It is the default component repository built into Apache Maven and is well-supported by other build
tools like Gradle, SBT or Ant/Ivy.

nuget.org-proxy:: This proxy repository accesses the http://www.nuget.org/[NuGet Gallery]. It is the default
component repository used by the `nuget` package management tool used for .Net development.

[[hosted-repository]]
==== Hosted Repository

A repository with the type 'hosted', also known as a hosted repository, is a repository that stores components in
the repository manager as the authoritative location for these components.

By default, the repository manager ships with the following configured hosted repositories:

maven-releases:: This hosted repository uses the 'maven2' repository format with a release version policy. It is
 intended to be the repository where your organization publishes internal releases. You can also use this
 repository for third-party components that are not available in external repositories and can therefore not be
 retrieved via a configured proxy repository. Examples of these components could be commercial, proprietary
 libraries such as an Oracle JDBC driver that may be referenced by your organization.

maven-snapshots:: This hosted repository uses the 'maven2' repository format with a snapshot version policy. It is
 intended to be the the repository where your organization publishes internal development versions, also known as
 snapshots.
 
nuget-hosted:: This hosted repository is where your organization can publish internal releases in repository using
the NuGet repository format. You can also use this repository for third-party components that are not available in
external repositories, that could potentially be proxied to gain access to the components.

[[repository-group]]
==== Repository Group

A repository with the type 'group', also known as repository group, represents a powerful feature of {nxrm}. 
They allow you to combine multiple repositories and other repository groups in a single repository. This in
turn means that your users can rely on a single URL for their configuration needs, while the administrators can
add more repositories and therefore components to the repository group.

The repository manager ships with the following groups:

maven-public:: The 'maven-public' group is a repository group of 'maven2' formatted repositories and combines the
important external proxy repository for the Central Repository with the hosted repositories 'maven-releases' and
'maven-snapshots'. This allows you to expose the components of the Central Repository as well as your internal
components in one single, simple-to-use repository and therefore URL.

nuget-group:: This group combines the nuget formatted repositories 'nuget-hosted' and 'nuget.org-proxy' into a
single repository for your .Net development with NuGet.

[[admin-repository-repositories]]
==== Managing Repositories and Repository Groups

The administration user interface for repositories and repository groups is available via the 'Repositories' item
in the 'Repository' sub menu of the 'Administration' menu. It allows you to create and configure repositories as
well as delete them and perform various maintenance operations. The initial view displayed in
<<fig-admin-repository-repositories-list>> features a list of all configured repositories and repository groups.

[[fig-admin-repository-repositories-list]]
.List of Repositories
image::figs/web/admin-repository-repositories-list.png[scale=80]

The list of repositories displays some information for each repository in the following columns

Name:: the unique name of the repository or repository group

Type:: the type of the repository with values of 'proxy' or 'hosted' for repositories or 'group' for a repository
group

Format:: the repository format used for the storage in the repository with values such as 'maven2', 'nuget' or
others

Status:: the status of the repository as well as further information about the status.  A functioning repository
would show the status to be 'Online'. Additional information can e.g., be about SSL certification problems or the
status of the remote repository for a currently disabled proxy repository

URL:: the 'copy' button prompts a dialog containing a direct URL path exposing the repository

Health Check:: displays the repository health statistics from a previously run {rhc}, or a button to start the
analysis

The 'Create repository' button above the repository list triggers a dialog to select the 'Recipe' for the new
repository. The recipe combines the format and the type of repository into a single selection. Depending on your
repository manager version and installed plugins, the list of available choices differs.

For example to create another release repository in 'maven2' format, you would click on the row with the recipe
'maven2 (hosted)' in the dialog. If you wanted to proxy a 'maven2' repository, choose 'maven 2 (proxy)'. On the
other hand if you want to proxy a nuget repository, choose 'nuget (proxy)'. With 'maven2 (group)' you can create a
repository group for 'maven2' repositories.

After this selection, you are presented with the configuration view, that allows you to fill in the required
parameters and some further configuration. The exact details on the view depend on the selected repository
provider and are identical to the administration for updating the configuration of a repository documented in the
following sections.

Once you have created a repository or repository group, it is available in the list for further configuration and
management.  Clicking on a specific row allows you to navigate to this repository specific administration
section. An example for the 'maven-central' repository is partially displayed in
<<fig-admin-repository-repositories-central>>.

[[fig-admin-repository-repositories-central]]
.Partial Repository Configuration for a Proxy Repository
image::figs/web/admin-repository-repositories-central.png[scale=50]

The repository administration feature view has buttons to perform various actions on a repository. The buttons
displayed depend on the repository format and type. The following buttons can be found:

Delete repository:: The 'Delete repository' button allows you to delete the repository and all related
configuration and components, after confirming the operation in a dialog.

Invalidate cache:: The 'Invalidate cache' button invalidates the caches for this repository. The exact behavior
depends on the repository type:

Proxy repositories;; Invalidating the cache on a proxy repository clears the proxy cache such that any items
cached as available will be checked again for any changes the next time they are requested. This also clears the
negative cache for the proxy repository such that any items that were not found within the defined cache period
will be checked again the next time they are requested.

Repository groups;; Invalidating the cache of a repository group, clears the group cache such that any items
fetched and held in the group cache, such as Maven metadata, will be cleared. This action also invalidates the
caches of any proxy and group repositories that are members of this group.

Rebuild Index:: The 'Rebuild Index' button allows you to drop and recreate the search index for the proxy
repository, synchronizing the contents with search index. This button is only available for proxy repositories.

The following properties can be viewed for all repositories and can not be edited after the initial creation of
the repository.

Name:: The 'Name' is the identifier that will be used in the URL for access to the repository. For example, the
proxy repository for the Central Repository has a name of +maven-central+.  The 'Name' must be unique in a given
repository manager installation and is required.

Format:: 'Format' defines in what format the repository manager exposes the repository to external
tools. Supported formats depend on the edition of the repository manager and the installed plugins. Examples are
'maven2', 'nuget', 'raw', 'docker', 'npm' and others.

Type:: The type of repository - 'proxy', 'hosted' or 'group'.

URL:: It shows the user facing URL this means that Maven and other tools can access the repository directly at
e.g., +http://localhost:8081/repository/maven-central+.

Online:: The checkbox allows you set whether this repository is available to client side tools or not.

Beyond the generic fields used for any repository, a number of different fields are used and vary depending on the
repository format and type. They are grouped under a number of specific headers that include configuration for the
related aspects and include:

* Storage
* Hosted
* Proxy
* Negative Cache 
* HTTP
* Maven 2
* NuGet
* and others

===== Storage

Every repository needs to have a 'Blob store' configured to determine where components are stored. The drop-down
allows you to select from all the configured blob stores. Documentation about creating blob stores can be found in
<<admin-repository-blobstores>>.

The 'Strict Content Type Validation' allows you to activate a validation that checks the MIME type of all files
published into a repository to conform to the allowed types for the specific repository format.

===== Hosted

A hosted repository includes configuration of a 'Deployment policy' in the 'Hosted' configuration section. Its
setting controls how a hosted repository allows or disallows component deployment.

If the policy is set to 'Read-only', no deployment is allowed.

If this policy is set to 'Disable redeploy', a client can only deploy a particular component once and any attempt
to deploy a component again will result in an error. The disabled redeploy is the default value, since most 
client tools assume components to be immutable and will not check a repository for changed components that have 
already been retrieved and cached locally.

If the policy is set to 'Allow redeploy', clients can deploy components to this repository and overwrite the same
component in subsequent deployments.

===== Proxy

The configuration for proxy repositories in the 'Proxy' section also contains the following parameters:

Remote Storage:: A proxy repository on the other hand requires the configuration of the 'Remote Storage'. It 
needs to be configured with the URL of the remote repository, that should to be proxied. When selecting the URL 
to proxy it is beneficial to avoid proxying remote repository groups. Proxying repository groups prevents some 
performance optimization in terms of accessing and retrieving the content of the remote repository. If you 
require components from the group that are found in different hosted repositories on the remote repository server 
it is better to create multiple proxy repositories that proxy the different hosted repositories from the remote 
server on your repository manager instead of simply proxying the group.

Use the Nexus truststore:: This checkbox allows you to elect for the repository manager to manage the SSL
certificate of the remote repository. It is only displayed - if the remote storage uses a HTTPS URL. The 'View
certificate' button triggers the display of the SSL certificate details in a dialog. The dialog allows you to add
or remove the certificate from the certificate truststore maintained by the repository manager. Further details
are documented in <<ssl-proxy-repo>>.

////
Download Remote Indexes;; Download the index of a remote repository can be configured with this setting. If
enabled, Nexus will download the index, if it exists, and use that for its searches as well as serve that up to
any clients that ask for the index (like m2eclipse). The default for new proxy repositories is enabled, but all of
the default repositories included in the repository manager have this option disabled. To change this setting for
one of the proxy repositories that ship with {nxrm}, change the option, save the repository, and then re-index the
repository. Once this is done, component search will return every component available on the Maven Central
repository.
////

Blocked:: Setting a repository to blocked causes the repository manager to no longer send outbound requests to the
remote repository.

Auto blocking enabled:: If 'Auto blocking enabled' is set to true, the repository manager automatically blocks a
proxy repository if the remote repository becomes unavailable. While a proxy repository is blocked, components
will still be served to clients from a local cache, but the repository manager will not attempt to locate an
component in a remote repository. The repository manager periodically retests the remote repository and unblocks
it once it becomes available.

Maximum component age:: When the proxy receives a request for a component, it does not request a new version from the
remote repository until the existing component is older than 'Maximum component age'.

Maximum metadata age:: The repository manager retrieves metadata from the remote repository.  It will only
retrieve updates to metadata after the 'Maximum metadata age' has been exceeded.  If the metadata is component
metadata, it uses the longer of this value and 'Maximum component age' before rechecking.

===== Negative Cache

Not found cache enabled/Not found cache TTL:: If the repository manager fails to locate a component, it will 
cache this result for a given number of minutes. In other words, if the repository manager can't find a component 
in a remote repository, it will not perform repeated attempts to resolve this component until the 'Not found cache 
TTL' time has been exceeded. The default for this setting is 1440 minutes (or 24 hours) and this cache is enabled 
by default.

[[http-options]]
===== HTTP 

The 'HTTP' configuration section allows you to configure the necessary details to access the remote repository,
even if you have to provide authentication details in order to access it successfully or if you have to connect 
to it via a proxy server.

NOTE: This configuration is only necessary, if it is specific to this repository. Global HTTP proxy and
authentication is documented in <<admin-system-http>>.

Authentication:: This section allows you to select 'Username' or 'Windows NTLM' as 'Authentication
type'. Subsequently you can provide the required 'Username' and 'Password' for plain authentication or 
'Username', 'Password', 'Windows NTLM hostname' and 'Windows NTLM domain' for 'Windows NTLM'-based 
authentication.

HTTP request settings:: In the 'HTTP request settings' you can change properties of the HTTP requests to the
remote repository. The values you can apply to this section are:

'User-agent customization';; Enter the string to be appended to user-agent HTTP headers.
'Connection retries';; Enter the total number of connection attempts after an initial timeout.
'Connection timeout';; Set the timeout interval for requests, in seconds.
'Enable circular redirects';; Allow proxy repositories to follow redirects indicated by the remote server even
 if they point to an already processed URL.
'Enable cookies';; Authorize HTTP cookies sent by the remote server, for future requests.

TIP: `https://maven.oracle.com` is a server that requires both 'Enable circular redirects' and 'Enable cookies'. 
This is because, when requesting data you are redirected to a queue of different URLs, most of which are involved 
with authentication. By enabling these options, you allow the repository manager to maintain the authentication 
state in a cookie that would be sent with each request, eliminating the need for the authentication-related 
redirects and avoiding timeouts.

Changes made to 'HTTP request settings' are applied to all HTTP requests made from the repository manager to
the remote repository being proxied. Enabling these settings will override any general settings defined in
<<admin-system-http>>.

////
File Content Validation;; If set to true, the repository manager performs a lightweight check on the content of
downloaded files. This will prevent invalid content to be stored and proxied by the repository manager that
otherwise can happen in cases where the remote repository (or some proxy between the repository manager and the
remote repository) returns a HTML page instead of the requested file.

Checksum policy;; Sets the checksum policy for a remote repository. This option is set to 'Warn' by default. The
possible values of this setting are:
+
* 'Ignore' - Ignore the checksums entirely
* 'Warn' - Print a warning in the log if a checksum is not correct
+
* 'StrictIfExists' - Refuse to cache an component if the calculated checksum is inconsistent with a checksum in
the repository. Only perform this check if the checksum file is present.
+
* 'Strict' - Refuse to cache an component if the calculated checksum is inconsistent or if there is no checksum
for an component.

Allow file browsing;; When set to true, users can browse the contents of the repository with a web browser.

Include in Search;; When set to true, this repository is included when you perform a search in the repository
manager. If this setting is false, the contents of the repository are excluded from a search.

Publish URL;; If this property is set to false, the repository will not be published on a URL, and you will not 
be able to access this repository remotely. You would set this configuration property to false if you want to 
prevent clients for connecting to this repository directly.

Expiration Settings:: The repository manager maintains a local cache of components and metadata, you can configure
expiration parameters for a proxy repository. The expiration settings are:

Item Max Age;; Some items in a repository may be neither an artifact identified by the Maven GAV coordinates or
metadata for such components. This cache value determines the maximum age for these items before updates are
retrieved.
////

Some repository formats include configuration options, such as these formats:

* 'Repository Connectors', 'Docker Registry API Support' and (for proxies) 'Docker Index' for Docker repositories 
  - <<docker-ssl-connector>>, <<docker-registry-api>> and <<docker-proxy>>
* 'Maven 2' for Maven repositories: <<maven-repository-format>> 
* 'NuGet' for NuGet proxy repositories: <<nuget-repository-format>>
* 'Bower' for Bower proxy repositories: <<bower-proxy>>

===== Repository Groups

The creation and configuration for a repository group differs a little from pure repositories. It allows you to
manage the member repositories of a repository group. An example for a repository group using the 'maven2' format
is visible in <<fig-group-config>>. In this figure you can see the contents of the 'maven-public' group that is
pre-configured in {nxrm}.

[[fig-group-config]]
.Repository Group Configuration
image::figs/web/admin-repository-repositories-group.png[scale=40]

The 'Format' and 'Type' are determined by the selection of the provider in the creation dialog e.g., 'maven2
(group)' for the 'maven-public' as a 'maven2' format repository group.

The 'Name' is set during the creation and is fixed once the repository group is created.

The 'Online' checkbox allows you set whether this repository group is available to client side tools or not.

The 'Member repositories' selector allows you to add repositories to the repository group as well as remove
them. The 'Members' column includes all the repositories that constitute the group. The 'Available' column
includes all the repositories and repository groups that can potentially be added to the group.

Note that the order of the repositories listed in the 'Member' section is important. When the repository manager
searches for a component in a repository group, it will return the first match. To reorder a repository in this
list, click and the drag the repositories and groups in the 'Members' list or use the arrow buttons between the
'Available' and 'Members' list. These arrows can be used to add and remove repositories as well.

The order of repositories or other groups in a group can be used to influence the effective metadata that will be
retrieved by Maven or other tools from a repository group. It is recommended practice to place hosted 
repositories higher in the list than proxy repositories. For proxy repositories, the repository manager needs to 
check the remote repository which will incur more overhead than a hosted repository lookup.

It is also recommended to place repositories with a higher probability of matching the majority of components 
higher in this list. If most of your components are going to be retrieved from the Central Repository, putting
'maven-central' higher in this list than a smaller, more focused repository is going to be better for 
performance, as the repository manager is not going to interrogate the smaller remote repository for as many 
missing components. These best practices are implemented in the default configuration.

==== Repository Management Example

The following sections detail some common steps of your repository management efforts on the example of a 
'maven2' repository.

[[config-sect-custom]]  
===== Adding Repositories for Missing Dependencies

If you've configured your Maven +settings.xml+ or other build tool configuration to use the +maven-public+
repository group as a mirror for all repositories, you might encounter projects that are unable to retrieve
components from your local repository manager installation.

TIP: More details about client tool configuration for Maven repositories can be found in <<maven>>.

This usually happens because you are trying to build a project that has defined a custom set of repositories and
snapshot repositories or relies on the content of other publicly available repositories in its configuration. When
you encounter such a project all you have to do is

* add this repository as a new 'maven2' format, proxy repository
* and then add the new proxy repository to the 'maven-public' group.

The advantage of this approach is that no configuration change on the build tool side is necessary at all.

[[config-sect-new-repo]]
===== Adding a New Repository

Once you have established the URL and format of the remote repository you are ready to configure the
repository. E.g. the JBoss.org releases repository contains your missing component. Click on the 'Create
repository' button in the 'Repositories' feature view and click on 'maven2 (proxy)' from the list in the dialog.

In the configuration dialog:

* Set 'Name' to +jboss-releases+
* Set 'Remote storage' to +https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases/+
* For a 'maven2' format repository, confirm that the 'Version policy' is set correctly to 'Release'.
* Click on the 'Create repository' button at the end of the form

The repository manager is now configured to proxy the repository. If the remote repository contains snapshots as
well as release components, you will need to repeat the process creating a second proxy repository with the same
URL setting version policy to 'Snapshot'.

[[config-sect-repo-group]]  
===== Adding a Repository to a Group

Next you will need to add the new repository 'jboss-releases' to the 'maven-public' repository group. To do this,
click on the row of the 'maven-public' group in the 'Repositories' feature view.

To add the new repository to the public group, find the repository in the 'Available' list on the left, click on
the repository you want to add and drag it to the right to the 'Members' list. Once the repository is in that
list, you can click and drag the repository within that list to alter the order in which the group will be
searched for a matching component. Press the 'Save' button to complete this configuration.

In the last few sections, you learned how to add new repositories to a build in order to download components that
are not available in the Central Repository.

If you were not using a repository manager, you would have added these repositories to the repository element of
your project's POM, or you would have asked all of your developers to modify +~/.m2/settings.xml+ to reference two
new repositories. Instead, you used the repository manager to add the two repositories to the public group. If all
of the developers are configured to point to the public group, you can freely swap in new repositories without
asking your developers to change local configuration, and you've gained a certain amount of control over which
repositories are made available to your development team. In addition the performance of the component resolving
across multiple repositories will be handled by the repository manager and therefore be much faster than client
side resolution done by Maven each time.

[[content-selectors]]
==== Content Selectors
{inall}

Content selectors provide a means for you to select specific content from all of your content. The content you 
select is evaluated against a JEXL expression. JEXL is an expression library used to script queries along 
specific paths and coordinates available to your repository manager formats.

Content selectors allow you to identify what selector privilege you can assign to a user. You can 
define, in a simplified example, a selector named Apache Maven with a search expression of 'path =^ 
"/org/apache/maven/"'. This would match all components that 'start with' the designated component path.

[[selector-create-query]]
===== Creating a Query

Before you identify user permissions for your selector, create the query first. Click 'Content Selectors' located 
in 'Repository', from the 'Administration' menu. Click 'Create selector' to open a new form.

In the 'Selector ID' section enter a 'Name' and (optional) 'Description' of your selector in the corresponding 
fields. In the 'Specification' section use the 'Search expression' field to build your query using JEXL syntax.

You can preview your selector and what results it will return by clicking the 'Preview results' button.  On 
click, a modal will appear as shown in <<fig-content-selector-preview>>.  The 'Expression' field will 
automatically be filled in with anything you had in the 'Search expression' field.  Similarly, any changes to 
'Expression' will be saved to 'Search expression' when you close the preview.

[[fig-content-selector-preview]]
.Content Selector Preview Modal
image::figs/web/content-selector-preview.png[scale=90]

To see results your selector would find, select a repository or grouping of repositories from the 'Preview 
Repository' dropdown and click the 'Preview' button.  Assets that match will be returned in the space below the 
filter and can be filtered upon if you wish to check on a specific result.  The 'Name' column is also sortable in 
ascending or descending order.  'Close' returns you to the content selector creation screen.

Once you are satisified with your fields, click 'Create selector' to create the Content Selector.  All saved 
selector queries you create will be listed in the 'Content Selectors' screen.

[[selector-permissions]]
===== Managing Selector Permissions

As part of your security setup, you can create user permissions to manage the filters you built in the 'Create 
Selector' form. You can add a new privilege that controls operations such as read, edit, delete, and '*' 
(all), for components matching that selector. The privilege can even span multiple repositories.

To create a new content selector privilege, click 'Privileges' in the 'Security' section of the 'Administration' 
panel. Then click the 'Create Privilege' button. Locate and click 'Repository Content Selector' from the list of 
options in 'Select Privilege Type'. You will see a form that displays the following:

* 'Name': Create a name for the content selector privilege.
* 'Description': Add a brief description for the privilege.
* 'Content Selector': Use this dropdown to select from a list of selectors you created.
* 'Repository': Use this dropdown to select from either a range of all repository contents, all repository 
contents of an individual format, or repositories created by you.
* 'Actions': Grant read, edit, delete, or '*' (all) privileges for user access control.
 
To complete the form, save the new privilege by clicking 'Create privilege'. You can use your new privilege to 
regulate what permissible data you want the user to access. You could group all related privileges into a 
role as documented in <<roles>>. Ultimately, you could assign your roles to a user, as mentioned in <<users>>.

A practical example might be where you delegate all control of components in 'org.apache.maven' to a "Maven" 
team. This way, you would not need to create separate repositories for each logical division of your components.

[[selector-reference]]
===== Content Selector Reference

Below are the allowable attributes for content selectors that define 'path', 'format', and 'coordinate' as values 
supported by {nxrm}.

[width="100%",options="header"]
|=============================================================
|Attribute  |Allowed Values
|path       |The path of your repository content
|format     |The format of the content for which you query
|coordinate |A map of attributes that differ by content format
|=============================================================

This table contains a description of attributes that can affect the respective formats. See the <<selector-examples,examples>>
below, for sample format queries against specific coordinates.

[width="100%",options="header"]
|==========================================================================================================
|Available Formats   |Coordinate Attributes
|maven2              |coordinate.groupId, coordinate.artifactId, coordinate.version, coordinate.classifier, coordinate.extension
|raw                 |(No coordinates)
|==========================================================================================================

[[selector-examples]]
===== Content Selector Examples

If, for example, you want to create a pattern that would capture all components within the format 'maven2' you 
can define it utilizing the variable 'format'. You can use the syntax available in this
https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/reference/syntax.html[JEXL guide] as a reference to create 
your queries.

JEXL examples may include:

*Select all 'raw' format content*

'format == "raw"'

*Select all 'maven2' content along a path that starts with 'org.apache.commons'*

'format == "maven2" && path =^ "/org/apache/commons/"'

TIP: When writing a content selector, remember that the asset's path will always begin with a leading slash when the
selector is evaluated. This is true even though the leading slash is not displayed when searching or browsing assets.

[[admin-license]]
=== License Management
{inrmonly}

A paid license is necessary to upgrade {oss} to {pro}, and to keep {pro} paid features operational. You must be 
logged in as a user with sufficient privileges to manage licenses.

[[admin-license-renew]]
==== Uploading a License

The paid license is a special +.lic+ file that you upload to the 'Licensing' feature view, found in the 
'Administration' menu. To install the license:

* Upload the file from the 'Select license...' button.
* Select the correct +.lic+ file in the file selection dialog, and press 'Open'.
* Click the 'Install license' button.
* Enter your password when the re-authentication dialog appears.
* Click 'I agree' to the terms stated in the End User License Agreement.
* Click 'Authenticate' to complete the upload.

After the file is successfully uploaded, you will receive a notification to restart the repository manager. After
restart the 'License type', shown in the 'Licensing' panel, will display the features associated with your 
license.

[[admin-lic-connections]]
==== Managing Recent Connections

Users with sufficient privileges can generate a record of users who had sessions within the last 7 days in the 
repository manager. In the Administration menu, go to the 'Recent Connections' feature view, nested below 
'Licensing', to access the table. 

The table displays the IP address ('IP'), last accessed date ('Date'), user name ('User'), and client ('User 
agent'). To generate the report click 'Download' to produce a CSV file of listed users.

When a {pro} license expires all functionality will be disabled in the user interface, except for the ability to 
install a new license file. To avoid interruption of service be sure to upload a renewed license before the 
existing license expires.  {pro} will provide a warning when the license is within 30 days of expiry.

=== Support Features

{nxrm} provides a number of features that allow you to ensure your server is configured correctly and
provides you with tools to investigate details about the configuration. This information can be useful for
troubleshooting and support activities.

All support features are available in the 'Support' group of the 'Administration' menu in the main menu section
and include:

* <<admin-support-analytics,Analytics>>
* <<admin-support-logging,Logging and Log Viewer>>
* <<admin-support-metrics,Metrics>>
* <<admin-support-supportzip,Support ZIP>>
* <<admin-support-systeminformation,System Information>>

[[admin-support-analytics]]
==== Analytics
{inall}

The analytics integration allows Sonatype to gather data about of your repository manager usage, since it enables
the collection of event data. It collects non-sensitive information about how you are using the repository manager
and allows Sonatype to achieve a better understanding of usage overall and therefore drive product innovation
following your needs.

The collected information is limited the primary interaction points between your environment and the repository
manager. None of the request specific data (e.g., credentials or otherwise sensitive information) is ever
captured.

TIP: The data is can be useful to you from a compatibility perspective, since it gathers answers to questions such
as what features are most important, where are users having difficulties, and what integrations/APIs are actively
in use.

You can enable the event logging in the 'Analytics' feature view available via 'Analytics' menu item in the
'Support' section of the 'Administration' menu. Select the checkbox beside 'Collect analytics events' and press
the 'Save' button.

You can choose to provide this data automatically to Sonatype by selecting the checkbox beside 'Enable anonymized
analytics submission to Sonatype'. It enables Sonatype to tailor the ongoing development of the
product. Alternatively, you can submit the data manually or just use the gathered data for your own analysis only.

Once enabled, all events logged can be inspected in the 'Events' feature view available via the 'Analytics'
section of the 'Administration' menu displayed in <<fig-analytics-events>>.

[[fig-analytics-events]]
.List of Analytics Events
image::figs/web/analytics-events.png[scale=50]

The list of events shows the 'Event type', the 'Timestamp', the 'Sequence' number and the 'Duration' of the event
as well as the 'User' that triggered it and any 'Attributes'. Each row has a '+' symbol in the first column that
allows you to expand the row vertically. Each attribute will be expanded into a separate line allowing you to
inspect all the information that is potentially submitted to Sonatype.

The 'User' value is replaced by a salted hash so that no username information is transmitted. The 'Anonymization
Salt' is automatically randomly generated and can optionally be configured in the 'Analytics: Collection'
capability manually. This administration area can additionally be used to change the random identifier for the
repository manager instance.

TIP: More information about capabilities can be found in <<admin-system-capabilities>>.

If you desire to further inspect the data that is potentially submitted, you can select to download the file
containing the JSON files in a zip archive by clicking the 'Export' button above the events list and downloading
the file. The 'Submit' button can be used to manually submit the events to Sonatype.

IMPORTANT: Sonatype values your input greatly and hopes you will activate the analytics feature and the automatic
submission to allow us to ensure ongoing development is well aligned with your needs. In addition, Sonatype 
appreciates any further direct contact and feedback in person and looks forward to hearing from you.

[[admin-support-logging]]
==== Logging and Log Viewer
{inall}

You can configure the level of logging for the repository manager and all plugins as well as inspect the current
log using the user interface with the 'Logging' and the 'Log Viewer' feature views.

Access the 'Logging' feature view displayed in <<fig-logging>> with the 'Logging' menu item in the 'Support'
section in the 'Administration' main menu.

[[fig-logging]]
.The Logging Feature View for Configuring Loggers
image::figs/web/logging.png[scale=60]

The 'Logging' feature view allows you to configure the preconfigured loggers as well as add and remove loggers. 
You can
modify the log level for a configured logger by clicking on the 'Level' value e.g., +INFO+. It will change into a
drop-down of the valid levels including +OFF+, +DEFAULT+, +INFO+ and others. Press the 'Update' button to apply 
the change.

The 'Create logger' button can be used to create new loggers. You will need to know the 'Logger name' you want to
configure. Typically this corresponds to the Java package name used in the source code. Depending on your needs 
you can inspect the source of {oss} and the plugins as well as the source of your own plugins to determine the 
related loggers or contact Sonatype support for detailed help.

If you select a row in the list of loggers, you can delete the highlighted logger by pressing the 'Delete logger' 
button above the list. This only applies to previously created custom loggers. To disable a default configured 
logger, set it to `OFF`.

IMPORTANT: When upgrading the repository manager, keep in mind that some loggers change between versions, so if
you rely on specific loggers, you might have to reconfigure them.

The 'Reset to default levels' button allows you to remove all your custom loggers and get back to the setup
shipped with a fresh install of the repository manager.

The loggers configured in the user interface are persisted into +$data-dir/etc/logback/logback-overrides.xml+ and
override any logging levels configured in the main +$install-dir/etc/logback/logback.xml+ file as well as other
+logback-*+ files. If you need to edit a logging level in those files, edit the overrides file. This will give
you access to edit the configuration in the user interface at a later stage and also ensure that the values you
configure take precedence.

The 'ROOT' logger level controls how verbose the logging is in general. If set to +DEBUG+, logging will be very
verbose, printing all log messages including debugging statements. If set to +ERROR+, logging will be far less
verbose, only printing out a log statement if the repository manager encounters an error. +INFO+ represents an
intermediate amount of logging.

TIP: When configuring logging, keep in mind that heavy logging can have a significant performance impact on an
application and any changes trigger the change to the logging immediately.

Once logging is configured as desired, you can inspect the impact of your configuration in the 'Log Viewer'
feature view. It allows you to copy the log from the server to your machine by pressing the 'Download' button. The
'Create mark' button allows you to add a custom text string into the log, so that you can create a reference point
in the log file for an analysis of the file. It will insert the text you entered surrounded by +*+ symbols as
visible in <<fig-log-viewer>>.

[[fig-log-viewer]]
.Viewing the Log with an Inserted Mark
image::figs/web/log-viewer.png[scale=50]

The 'Refresh interval' configuration on the right on the top of the view allows you to configure the timing for
the refresh as well as the size of the log displayed. A manual refresh can be triggered with the general refresh
button in the main toolbar.


[[admin-support-metrics]]
==== Metrics
{inall}

The 'Metrics' feature view is available in the 'Support' section of the 'Administration' main menu. It provides
insight to characteristics of the Java virtual machine JVM running the repository manager and is displayed in
<<fig-metrics>>.

[[fig-metrics]]
.JVM Metrics
image::figs/web/metrics.png[scale=40]

The 'Memory usage', 'Memory distribution' and 'Thread states' charts provide some simple visualizations. The
'Download' button allows you to retrieve a large number of properties from the JVM and download them in a
JSON-formatted text file. Pressing the 'Thread dump' button triggers the creation of a thread dump of the JVM and
a download of the resulting text file.

[[admin-support-supportzip]]
==== Support ZIP
{inall}

The 'Support ZIP' feature view allows you to create a ZIP archive file that you can submit to Sonatype support 
via email or a support ticket. The checkboxes in 'Contents' and 'Options' allow you to control the content and size of
the archive.

The repository manager implements security measures when a support ZIP is generated. Sensitive password related
information is removed from generated files. When a support ZIP download is attempted, you may be prompted to verify
your repository manager account credentials.

Support ZIP archive files are stored on the server under the `$data-dir/downloads` directory using a name which includes
 the time the file was generated.

[[admin-support-supportzip-create]]
===== Creating a Support ZIP

. Sign in to the user interface using the default 'admin' account or any account with the 'nx-admin' role.
. Click the cog icon in the top toolbar to open the administration interface.
. Select 'Support' and then 'Support ZIP' sidebar menu items.
. Review the options and click the 'Create Support ZIP' button. A popup dialog will be shown when the support zip
  generation is complete.
. Either download the support ZIP using the 'Download' button or use the file path shown to retrieve the file from the
  `$data-dir/downloads` directory.

[[admin-support-systeminformation]]
==== System Information
{inall}

The 'System Information' feature view displays a large number of configuration details related to

Nexus:: details about the versions of the repository manager and the installed plugins, install and work directory
location, application host and port and a number of other properties.

Java Virtual Machine:: all system properties like +java.runtime.name+, +os.name+ and many more as known by the JVM
