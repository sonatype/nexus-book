[[configuration-introduction]]
=== Introduction

This chapter covers all aspects of configuring {pro} and {oss}. Specifically the sections and menu items of the
'Administration' main menu are covered. It can be accessed by authorized users by pressing the 'Administration'
button image:figs/web/ui-admin-button-icon.png[scale=50] in the main toolbar.

Many of the features shown in this section are only available to administrative users and are available in
{oss}. Some features are only available in {pro}. The 'Administration' menu contains the following sections:

////

TBD add link to all the items below once they are documented

////

'Repository':: The 'Repository' section allows you to manage all 'Repositories' and related configurations such as
'Routing' and 'Targets'.

////
'Staging' ({pro} only):: The 'Staging' menu section can be used to configure 'Profiles' and 'Rules' used in the
staging suite.

'CLM' ({pro} only):: Allows you to configure the integration of {pro} with {iq}.
////

'Security':: This section provides access to all the configuration features related to authentication and
authorization of users including 'Privileges', 'Roles', 'Users', but also 'LDAP', 'Atlassian Crowd', 'SSL
Certificates' and 'User Token'.

'Support':: Access a number of features that allow you to administer and monitor your repository manager
successfully like 'Logging' and 'System Information'.

'System':: The <<system, general configuration>> for getting started and running the repository manager
with e.g., <<admin-system-http, 'HTTP'>> or <<admin-system-emailserver,'Email Server'>> settings, but also
<<admin-system-capabilities,'Capabilities'>> and <<admin-system-tasks,'Tasks'>> to run regularly and other
configurations.

[[getting-started]]
=== Getting Started

tbd ... write about what to do when first getting going, some system config and some repo config probably, take from
other section in book and training..

this should link to the various sections
////


[[system]]
=== System Configuration

The 'System' section of the 'Administration' menu gives you access to a number of configuration features that you
typically need to configure, after successful installation. The following sections detail:

* Access information about used <<admin-system-bundles,Bundles>>
* Advanced configuration with <<admin-system-capabilities,Capabilities>>
* <<admin-system-emailserver,Email/SMTP server configuration>>
* <<admin-system-http,HTTP/HTTPS proxy server configuration>>
* Configuration and management of automated maintenance <<admin-system-tasks,Tasks>>

[[admin-system-bundles]]
==== Bundles
{inall}

The {pro} application runs on the OSGi container http://felix.apache.org/[Apache Felix]. All features and plugins
are managed by the container and are implemented as OSGi bundles.

The 'Bundles' feature view is available in the 'System' section of the 'Administration' main menu. It allows you
to inspect a list of all the OSGi bundles that are deployed as part of the application and access detailed
information about each bundle.

TIP: Find out more about OSGi and OSGi bundles on the http://www.osgi.org/[website of the OSGi Alliance].

[[admin-system-capabilities]]
==== Accessing and Configuring Capabilities
{inall}

Capabilities are features of the repository manager and plugins that can be configured by a user in a generic
administration feature view accessible in the 'System' section of the 'Administration' main menu via
'Capabilities'.

{nexus} ships with a number of capabilities preinstalled and allows you to enable/disable them. An example
capability is 'Outreach: Management' displayed in <<fig-capability-outreach>>.

[[fig-capability-outreach]]
.Outreach: Management Capability Settings
image::figs/web/capability-outreach.png[scale=60]

The list of capabilities can be filtered with the search input box in the header of the list and sorted by the
different columns by pressing a column header. The list uses the following columns:

State:: The state column does not have a title. Enabled capabilities have a green checkmark added on top of a blue
icon. Disabled capabilities use a greyed out icon.

Type:: The 'Type' column provides the specific type of a capability in the list.

Category:: The 'Category' is optional and details the wider context the capability belongs to.

Description:: The 'Description' column contains further descriptive information about the capability.

Notes:: The 'Notes' column can contain user created text about the capability.

Every capability can be inspected and configured by selecting it in the list. The resulting view display the
'Summary' view of the specific capability. This view includes the display of 'Type', 'State' and optionally
'Category' and 'Description' in the 'Summary' section as well as further information in the 'Status', 'About' and
'Notes' sections.  The 'Status' section displays a text message that details the status of the capability and any
potential problems with the configuration.  Depending on the capability, the reasons can vary widely.  The 'About'
section displays a descriptive text about the purpose of the capability.  The 'Notes' field can be used to provide
a descriptive text about the capability or any other notes related to it and can be persisted by pressing the
'Save' button.

The 'Delete' button below the title allows you to remove a capability and it's configuration entirely. The
'Enable' and 'Disable' buttons on the other hand can be used to switch the state of the capability.

The 'Settings' view allows you to activate or deactivate the capability with the 'Enable this capability'
checkbox. Below this checkbox, each capability type has specific additional configuration parameters
available. Once you have completed the configuration, press the 'Save' button.

The capabilities management feature view supports adding new capabilities by pressing the 'Create capability'
button above the list and selecting the desired capability 'Type' from the list. The next view allows you to
perform any capability-specific configuration and finish the process by pressing the 'Create capability' button
below the parameters.

Many of the built-in capabilities and plugins can be configured in the 'Capabilities' administration section but
also in other more user friendly, targeted user interface sections, e.g., the user token feature of {pro} can be
administrated by using the interface available via the 'User Token' menu item in the 'Security' section of the
'Administration' menu as well as by editing the user token capability. Other capabilities are internal
functionality and sometimes managed automatically by the responsible plugin. Some optional configuration like the
branding plugin or advanced features of the smart proxy configuration are only done in the capabilities
administration.

Usage of specific capabilities to achieve a variety of tasks is detailed in parts of the documentation.

////
tbd  ... add links to all sections maybe.. 

The branding plugin allows the customization of the icon in the top left-hand corner of the user interface header and is
described in <<nexus-branding>>.
////

WARNING: In many cases you will not need to configure anything in 'Capabilities' unless explicitly instructed to
do so by the support team. Execute any capability changes with caution, potentially backing up your configuration
before proceeding.

[[admin-system-emailserver]]
==== Email Server
{inall}

The repository manager can send emails to users who need to recover usernames and passwords, as notifications for
staging and a number of other uses. In order for these notifications to work, you need to configure the connection
to the SMTP server that sends the email and some other aspects of the email messages themselves. This
configuration is available via the 'Email Server' menu item in the 'System' section of the 'Administration' menu
and displayed in <<fig-config-administration-smtp>>.

[[fig-config-administration-smtp]]
.Email Server Configuration
image::figs/web/admin-system-emailserver.png[scale=60]

The following configuration options are available:

Enabled:: Determines whether email sending is activated or not, independent of a server being configured.

Host and Port:: The name of the host and the port to use to connect to the SMTP server.

Use the Nexus truststore:: This checkbox allows you to configure the repository manager to use its certificate
truststore. You can also view and import the certificate from the email server. Further details are documented in
<<ssl>>.

Username and Password:: The credentials of the user of the SMTP server to use for authentication.

From address:: This parameter defines the email address used in the +From:+ header of any email sent by the
repository manager. Typically, this is configured as a "Do-Not-Reply" email address or a mailbox or mailing list
monitored by the administrators of the repository manager.

Subject prefix:: This parameter allows you to define a prefix used in the subject line of all emails sent by the
repository manager. This allows the recipients to set up automatic filtering and sorting easily. An example is
`[Nexus Notification]`.

SSL/TLS options:: These options can be used to configure usage of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) when emails are sent by the repository manager using SMTP. These options include the ability
to use STARTTLS, which upgrades the initially established, plain connection to be encrypted when sending
emails. The following options are available to you:

Enable STARTTLS support for insecure connections;; This checkbox allows you to enable support for upgrading
insecure connections using STARTTLS.

Require STARTTLS support;; This checkbox requires that insecure connections are upgraded using STARTTLS. If this
is not supported by the SMTP server, no emails are sent.

Enable SSL/TLS encryption upon connection;; This checkbox enables SSL/TLS encryption for the transport on
connection using SMTPS/POPS.

Enable server identity check;; This option verifies the server certificate when using TLS or SSL, following the
RFC 2595 specification.

Once you have configured the parameters you can use the 'Verify email server' button to confirm the configured
parameters and the successful connection to the server. You are asked to provide an email address that should
receive a test email message. Successful sending is confirmed in a message.

[[admin-system-general]]
==== General Server Settings
{inall}

The 'General' server configuration is available via the 'System' section of the 'Administration' menu and displayed in
<<fig-admin-system-general>>.

You can change the 'Base URL' for your repository manager installation, which is used when generating links in
emails and RSS feeds. For example, the instance for Sonatype development is available at
http://respository.sonatype.org, and it makes use of this 'Base URL' field to ensure that links in emails and RSS
feeds point to the correct URL. Internally the repository manager is running on a different port and context than
the public port 80 and root context.

[[fig-admin-system-general]]
.Configuration of General Server Settings
image::figs/web/admin-system-general.png[scale=50]

TIP: This configuration is especially important if the repository manager is proxied by an external proxy server
using a different protocol like HTTPS rather than plain HTTP known to the repository manager or a different
hostname like repository.somecompany.com instead of an IP number only.
////

[[admin-system-http]]
==== HTTP and HTTPS Request and Proxy Settings
{inall}

The repository manager uses HTTP requests to fetch content from remote servers. In some cases a customization of
these requests is required. Many organizations use proxy servers for any outbound HTTP network traffic. The
connection to these proxy servers from the repository manager needs to be configured to allow it to reach remote
repositories. All this can be configured in the 'HTTP' configuration available via the 'System' section of the
'Administration' menu and displayed in <<fig-admin-system-http>>.

[[fig-admin-system-http]]
.Configuring HTTP Request Settings
image::figs/web/admin-system-http.png[scale=50]

User-agent customization:: The HTTP configuration in 'User-agent customization' allows you to append a string to
the +User-Agent+ HTTP header field. This can be a required customization by your proxy servers.

Connection/Socket timeout and attempts:: The amount of time in seconds the repository manager waits for a request
to succeed when interacting with an external, remote repository as well as the number of retry attempts to make
when requests fail can be configured with these settings.

If your repository manager instance needs to reach public repositories like the Central Repository via a proxy
server, you can configure the connection to a proxy server. Typically such an internal proxy server proxies HTTP
as well as HTTPS connections to external repositories. In this case you configure a HTTP proxy. Select the
checkbox beside 'HTTP Proxy' and configure the parameters in the sections displayed in
<<fig-admin-system-http-proxy>>. If your organization uses a separate, additional proxy server for HTTPS
connections, you have to configure it in the 'HTTPS Proxy' section.

TIP: This is a critical initial step for many Enterprise deployments of {pro} and {oss}, since these environments
are typically secured via an HTTP/HTTPS proxy server for all outgoing internet traffic.

[[fig-admin-system-http-proxy]]
.Configuring HTTP Proxy Settings
image::figs/web/admin-system-http-proxy.png[scale=50]

You can specify the 'HTTP proxy host' and the 'HTTP proxy port' of the HTTP or HTTPS proxy server and, optionally,
the 'Authentication' details for 'Username' and 'Password'. If a Windows NT LAN Manager is used to authenticate
with the proxy server you can configure the needed connection details in 'Windows NTKM hostname' and 'Windows NTLM
domain'.

In addition, you can configure a number of hosts that the repository manager reaches directly, ignoring the proxy
settings. Requests to them should not go through the configured HTTP/HTTPS proxy. These hosts can be configured in
the 'Hosts to exclude from HTTP/HTTPS proxy' setting. You can add a hostname in the input box and add it with the
`+` button. The `*` character can be used for wildcard matching for numerous host names allowing a setting such as
`*.example.com`. Entries can be removed with the `x` button.

<<fig-admin-system-http-proxy>> shows the 'HTTP Proxy' administration interface. The HTTPS configuration interface
looks the same and is found below the HTTP configuration.

[[admin-system-tasks]]
==== Configuring and Executing Tasks
{inall}

The repository manager allows you to schedule the execution of maintenance tasks. The tasks can carry out regular
maintenance steps that will be applied to all repositories or to specific repositories on a configurable schedule
or simply perform other system maintenance. Use the 'Tasks' menu item in the 'System' section of the
'Administration' menu to access the feature view, shown in <<fig-repomap-scheduled>>, that allows you to manage
your 'Tasks'.

[[fig-repomap-scheduled]]
.Managing Tasks
image::figs/web/tasks.png[scale=50]

The list interface allows you to add new tasks with the 'Create task' button as well as inspect and work with the
configured tasks. The list shows the following columns:

Name:: A user-defined name for the task to identify it in the user interface and log files.

Type:: The type of action the scheduled task executes. The list of available task types is documented in more
detail below.

Status:: Tasks can either be 'Waiting' for their next run, currently 'Running' or 'Disabled'.

Schedule:: The 'Schedule' column shows the 'Task frequency' e.g., 'Daily', 'Monthly', 'Manual' and others.

Next run:: This column displays date and time of the next execution of the task based on the configured schedule.

Last run and Last result:: These columns display the date and time as well as the result and duration of the last
execution of the specific task.

When creating or updating a scheduled task, you can configure the following additional properties:

Task enabled:: Enable or disable a specific task with the checkbox.

Notification Email:: Configure a notification email for task execution failures. If a scheduled task fails a
notification email containing the task identifier and name as well as the stack trace of the failure will be sent
to the configured email recipient.

Task frequency:: Selecting the task frequency allows you to configure the schedule for the task
executions. Available choices are 'Manual', 'Once', 'Hourly', 'Daily', 'Weekly', 'Monthly' and 'Advanced (provide
a CRON expression)'. Apart from 'Manual', all choices trigger display of a custom user interface for scheduling
the specific recurrence. Weekly scheduling requires at least one day of the week to be selected. The advanced
setting allows you to provide a CRON expression to configure more complex schedules. 

The 'Start date' and 'Start time' allow you to configure a specific date and time from when the schedule should be
activated. The 'Time to run this task' settings is used to configure the actual time of the task execution.

Task-type specific configuration is displayed below the notification email input and differs for each scheduled
task.

The following task types are available to perform specific maintenance:

Compact blob store:: Content deleted from a <<admin-repository-blobstores,blob store>> is not physically deleted
from the storage device. Instead they are only internally marked for deletion. This task performs the actual
deletion of the relevant files, and therefore frees up the storage space.

////
Execute Script:: Scripts can be provided in the 'Source' field and have to be written using the Groovy programming
language. These scripts can use the APIs of the repository manager to perform maintenance and other modification
tasks. Please consult the Javadoc and source for further information.
////

Publish Maven Indexer Indexes:: Maven indexes can be used to download an index of available components to a client
including e.g. a developer's IDE. The task publishes the index for all or a specific 'maven2'-formatted
repository.

Purge Incomplete Docker Uploads:: Docker uploads to a repository can be hundreds of MB in size. It is possible to
have incomplete uploads or orphaned files remain in temporary storage as a result of incomplete or interrupted
uploads. The temporary storage consumed by these incomplete or orphaned uploads can be cleaned up with this
task. You can configure the minimum age of incomplete uploads to be purged and have them deleted by the task
execution. In addition, any incomplete Docker uploads that have been orphaned by a Nexus restart will be cleaned
up whenever the task executes.

Purge Orphaned API Keys:: This scheduled tasks deletes old, unused API keys. These keys are generated, for
example, when using the User Token feature or publishing to NuGet repositories. A key becomes unused, when the
user account is deleted. The task purges these orphaned API keys and should be scheduled to run regularly to
remove these redundant keys.

Purge Unused Components and Assets:: This task can be used to remove components and assets in proxy repositories.
Any component that has not been requested in the configured number of days will be purged.

Purge Unused Maven Snapshots:: This task can be used to remove unused snapshots from Maven repositories. Any
snapshot that has not been requested in the configured number of days will be purged.

Rebuild Maven Repository Metadata:: This task rebuilds the maven-metadata.xml files with the correct information
and will also validate the checksums (.md5/.sha1) for all files in the specified maven2 hosted repository. The
'Group Id', 'Artifact Id' and 'Base Version' parameters allow you to narrow down the section of the repository
that will be repaired. Typically this task is run manually to repair a corrupted repository.

Rebuild Repository Index:: With support for hosted and proxy repositories, this task can rebuild the index. It
inspects actual components and assets found in the repository and rebuilds the index to reflect the true content
for supporting search and browse actions.

Un-publish Maven Indexer Indexes:: This task is the counter-part to the task 'Publish Maven Indexer Indexes' and
can remove the index.

Beyond these tasks any plugin can provide additional scheduled tasks, which will appear once you have installed 
the plugin.

Setting up tasks execution adapted to your usage of the repository manager is an important first step when 
setting up a {pro} or {oss} instance. Go through the list of task types and consider your usage patterns. In 
addition update your tasks when changing your usage. E.g., if you start to regularly deploy snapshots by 
introducing continuous integration server builds with deployment.

[[admin-repositories]]
=== Repository Management
{inall}

Repositories are the containers for the components provided to your users as explained in more detail in
<<concepts>>. Creating and managing repositories is an essential part of your {pro} and {oss} configuration, since
it allows you to expose more components to your users.

It supports proxy repositories, hosted repositories and repository groups using a number of different repository
formats.

The binary parts of a repository are stored in blob stores, which can be configured by selecting 'Blob stores'
from the 'Repository' sub menu of the 'Administration' menu.

To manage repositories select the 'Repositories' item in the 'Repository' sub menu of the 'Administration' menu.

[[admin-repository-blobstores]]
==== Blob Stores

A blob store is a storage mechanism for the binary parts of the components and their assets. Each blob
store can be used by one or multiple repositories and repository groups. A 'default' blob store that is
based on a file system storage within the `data` directory configured during the installation is automatically
configured.

The 'Blob stores' feature view available via the 'Blob stores' item in the 'Repository' sub menu of the
'Administration' menu displays a list of all configured blob stores. The columns provide some detail about each
blob store:

Name:: the name of the blob store as displayed in the repository administration
Type:: the type of the blob store backend, currently only 'File' is available representing a file system-based storage
Blob count:: the number of blobs currently stored
Total size:: the size of the blob store in MB
Available space:: the overal space available for the blob store

Click on a specific row to inspect further details of the selected blob store. The details view displays 'Type'
and 'Name' and the absolute 'Path' to the file system storage.

The 'Create blob store' button allows you to add further blob stores. You can configure the 'Type' and 'Name' for
the blob store. The 'Path' parameter should be an absolute path to the desired file system location. It has to be
fully accessible by the operating system user account running the Nexus repository manager.

Once a blob store has been created it can no longer be modified and any blob store used by a repository or
repository group can not be deleted.

Blobs deleted in a repository are only marked for deletion. The 'Compact blob store' <<admin-system-tasks,task>>
can be used to permanently delete these 'soft-deleted' blobs and therefore free up the used storage space.

[[proxy-repository]]
==== Proxy Repository

A repository with the type 'proxy', also known as a proxy repository, is a repository that is linked to a remote
repository. Any request for a component is verified against the local content of the proxy repository. If no local
component is found, the request is forwarded to the remote repository. The component is then retrieved and stored
locally in the repository manager, which acts as a cache. Subsequent requests for the same component are then
fulfilled from the local storage, therefore eliminating the network bandwidth and time overhead of retrieving the
component from the remote repository again.

By default, the repository manager ships with the following configured proxy repositories:

maven-central:: This proxy repository accesses the http://search.maven.org/[Central Repository], formerly known as
Maven Central. It is the default component repository built into Apache Maven and is well-supported by other build
tools like Gradle, SBT or Ant/Ivy.

nuget.org-proxy:: This proxy repository accesses the http://www.nuget.org/[NuGet Gallery]. It is the default
component repository used by the `nuget` package management tool used for .Net development.

[[hosted-repository]]
==== Hosted Repository

A repository with the type 'hosted', also known as a hosted repository, is a repository that stores components in
the repository manager as the authoritative location for these components.

By default, the repository manager ships with the following configured hosted repositories:

maven-releases:: This hosted repository uses the 'maven2' repository format with a release version policy. It is
 intended to be the repository where your organization publishes internal releases. You can also use this
 repository for third-party components that are not available in external repositories and can therefore not be
 retrieved via a configured proxy repository. Examples of these components could be commercial, proprietary
 libraries such as an Oracle JDBC driver that may be referenced by your organization.

maven-snapshots:: This hosted repository uses the 'maven2' repository format with a snapshot version policy. It is
 intended to be the the repository where your organization publishes internal development versions, also known as
 snapshots.
 
nuget-hosted:: This hosted repository is where your organization can publish internal releases in repository using
the NuGet repository format. You can also use this repository for third-party components that are not available in
external repositories, that could potentially be proxied to gain access to the components.

[[repository-group]]
==== Repository Group

A repository with the type 'group', also known as repository group, represents a powerful feature of {pro} and
{oss}. They allow you to combine multiple repositories and other repository groups in a single repository. This in
turn means that your users can rely on a single URL for their configuration needs, while the administrators can
add more repositories and therefore components to the repository group.

The repository manager ships with the following groups:

maven-public:: The 'maven-public' group is a repository group of 'maven2' formatted repositories and combines the
important external proxy repository for the Central Repository with the hosted repositories 'maven-releases' and
'maven-snapshots'. This allows you to expose the components of the Central Repository as well as your internal
components in one single, simple-to-use repository and therefore URL.

nuget-group:: This group combines the nuget formatted repositories 'nuget-hosted' and 'nuget.org-proxy' into a
single repository for your .Net development with NuGet.

[[admin-repository-repositories]]
==== Managing Repositories and Repository Groups

The administration user interface for repositories and repository groups is available via the 'Repositories' item
in the 'Repository' sub menu of the 'Administration' menu. It allows you to create and configure repositories as
well as delete them and perform various maintenance operations. The initial view displayed in
<<fig-admin-repository-repositories-list>> features a list of all configured repositories and repository groups.

[[fig-admin-repository-repositories-list]]
.List of Repositories
image::figs/web/admin-repository-repositories-list.png[scale=50]

The list of repositories displays some information for each repository in the following columns

Name:: the unique name of the repository or repository group

Type:: the type of the repository with values of 'proxy' or 'hosted' for repositories or 'group' for a repository
group

Format:: the repository format used for the storage in the repository with values such as 'maven2', 'nuget' or
others

Status:: the status of the repository as well as further information about the status.  A functioning repository
would show the status to be 'Online'. Additional information can e.g., be about SSL certification problems or the
status of the remote repository for a currently disabled proxy repository

URL:: the direct URL path that exposes the repository via HTTP access and potentially, depending on the repository
format, allows access and directory browsing

////
Health Check:: the result counts for a repository health check or a
button to start the analysis

TBD as documented in <<rhc>>
////

The 'Create repository' button above the repository list triggers a dialog to select the 'Recipe' for the new
repository. The recipe combines the format and the type of repository into a single selection. Depending on your
repository manager version and installed plugins, the list of available choices differs.

For example to create another release repository in 'maven2' format, you would click on the row with the recipe
'maven2 (hosted)' in the dialog. If you wanted to proxy a 'maven2' repository, choose 'maven 2 (proxy)'. On the
other hand if you want to proxy a nuget repository, choose 'nuget (proxy)'. With 'maven2 (group)' you can create a
repository group for 'maven2' repositories.

After this selection, you are presented with the configuration view, that allows you to fill in the required
parameters and some further configuration. The exact details on the view depend on the selected repository
provider and are identical to the administration for updating the configuration of a repository documented in the
following sections.

Once you have created a repository or repository group, it is available in the list for further configuration and
management.  Clicking on a specific row allows you to navigate to this repository specific administration
section. An example for the 'maven-central' repository is partially displayed in
<<fig-admin-repository-repositories-central>>.

[[fig-admin-repository-repositories-central]]
.Partial Repository Configuration for a Proxy Repository
image::figs/web/admin-repository-repositories-central.png[scale=50]

The repository administration feature view has buttons to perform various actions on a repository. The buttons
displayed depend on the repository format and type. The following buttons can be found:

Delete repository:: The 'Delete repository' button allows you to delete the repository and all related
configuration and components, after confirming the operation in a dialog.

Invalidate cache:: The 'Invalidate cache' button invalidates the caches for this repository. The exact behavior
depends on the repository type:

Proxy repositories;; Invalidating the cache on a proxy repository clears the proxy cache such that any items
cached as available will be checked again for any changes the next time they are requested. This also clears the
negative cache for the proxy repository such that any items that were not found within the defined cache period
will be checked again the next time they are requested.

Repository groups;; Invalidating the cache of a repository group, clears the group cache such that any items
fetched and held in the group cache, such as Maven metadata, will be cleared. This action also invalidates the
caches of any proxy and group repositories that are members of this group.

Rebuild Index:: The 'Rebuild Index' button allows you to drop and recreate the search index for the proxy
repository, synchronizing the contents with search index. This button is only available for proxy repositories.

The following properties can be viewed for all repositories and can not be edited after the initial creation of
the repository.

Name:: The 'Name' is the identifier that will be used in the URL for access to the repository. For example, the
proxy repository for the Central Repository has a name of +maven-central+.  The 'Name' must be unique in a given
repository manager installation and is required.

Format:: 'Format' defines in what format the repository manager exposes the repository to external
tools. Supported formats depend on the edition of the repository manager and the installed plugins. Examples are
'maven2', 'nuget', 'raw', 'docker', 'npm' and others.

Type:: The type of repository - 'proxy', 'hosted' or 'group'.

URL:: It shows the user facing URL this means that Maven and other tools can access the repository directly at
e.g., +http://localhost:8081/repository/maven-central+.

Online:: The checkbox allows you set whether this repository is available to client side tools or not.

Beyond the generic fields used for any repository, a number of different fields are used and vary depending on the
repository format and type. They are grouped under a number of specific headers that include configuration for the
related aspects and include:

* Storage
* Hosted
* Proxy
* Negative Cache 
* HTTP
* Maven 2
* NuGet
* and others

===== Storage

Every repository needs to have a 'Blob store' configured to determine where components are stored. The drop-down
allows you to select from all the configured blob stores. Documentation about creating blob stores can be found in
<<admin-repository-blobstores>>.

The 'Strict Content Type Validation' allows you to activate a validation that checks the MIME type of all files
published into a repository to conform to the allowed types for the specific repository format.

===== Hosted

A hosted repository includes configuration of a 'Deployment policy' in the 'Hosted' configuration section. Its
setting controls how a hosted repository allows or disallows component deployment.

If the policy is set to 'Read-only', no deployment is allowed.

If this policy is set to 'Disable redeploy', a client can only deploy a particular component once and any attempt
to deploy a component again will result in an error. The disabled redeploy is the default value, since most client
tools assume components to be immutable and will not check a repository for changed components that have already
been retrieved and cached locally.

If the policy is set to 'Allow redeploy', clients can deploy components to this repository and overwrite the same
component in subsequent deployments.

===== Proxy

The configuration for proxy repositories in the 'Proxy' section also contains the following parameters:

Remote Storage:: A proxy repository on the other hand requires the configuration of the 'Remote Storage'. It needs
to be configured with the URL of the remote repository, that should to be proxied. When selecting the URL to proxy
it is beneficial to avoid proxying remote repository groups. Proxying repository groups prevents some performance
optimization in terms of accessing and retrieving the content of the remote repository. If you require components
from the group that are found in different hosted repositories on the remote repository server it is better to
create multiple proxy repositories that proxy the different hosted repositories from the remote server on your
repository manager instead of simply proxying the group.

Use the Nexus truststore:: This checkbox allows you to elect for the repository manager to manage the SSL
certificate of the remote repository. It is only displayed - if the remote storage uses a HTTPS URL. The 'View
certificate' button triggers the display of the SSL certificate details in a dialog. The dialog allows you to add
or remove the certificate from the certificate truststore maintained by the repository manager. Further details
are documented in <<ssl-proxy-repo>>.


////
Download Remote Indexes;; Download the index of a remote repository can be configured with this setting. If
enabled, Nexus will download the index, if it exists, and use that for its searches as well as serve that up to
any clients that ask for the index (like m2eclipse). The default for new proxy repositories is enabled, but all of
the default repositories included in the repository manager have this option disabled. To change this setting for
one of the proxy repositories that ship with {pro}, change the option, save the repository, and then re-index the
repository. Once this is done, component search will return every component available on the Maven Central
repository.
////

Blocked:: Setting a repository to blocked causes the repository manager to no longer send outbound requests to the
remote repository.

Auto blocking enabled:: If 'Auto blocking enabled' is set to true, the repository manager automatically blocks a
proxy repository if the remote repository becomes unavailable. While a proxy repository is blocked, components
will still be served to clients from a local cache, but the repository manager will not attempt to locate an
component in a remote repository. The repository manager periodically retests the remote repository and unblocks
it once it becomes available.

Maximum component age:: When the proxy receives a request for a component, it does not request a new version from the
remote repository until the existing component is older than 'Maximum component age'.

Maximum metadata age:: The repository manager retrieves metadata from the remote repository.  It will only
retrieve updates to metadata after the 'Maximum metadata age' has been exceeded.  If the metadata is component
metadata, it uses the longer of this value and 'Maximum component age' before rechecking.

////
tbd once fixed..  The default for this setting is -1 for a repository with a release policy and 1440 for a repository
with snapshot policy.
////


===== Negative Cache

Not found cache enabled/Not found cache TTL:: If the repository manager fails to locate a component, it will cache
this result for a given number of minutes. In other words, if the repository manager can't find a component in a
remote repository, it will not perform repeated attempts to resolve this component until the 'Not found cache TTL'
time has been exceeded. The default for this setting is 1440 minutes (or 24 hours) and this cache is enabled by
default.

===== HTTP 

The 'HTTP' configuration section allows you to configure the necessary details to access the remote repository,
even if you have to provide authentication details in order to acces it successfully or if you have to connect to
it via a proxy server.

NOTE: This configuration is only necessary, if it is specific to this repository. Global HTTP proxy and
authentication is documented in <<admin-system-http>>.

Authentication:: This section allows you to select 'Username' or 'Windows NTLM' as 'authentication
type'. Subsequently you can provide the required 'Username' and 'Password' for plain authentication or 'Username',
'Password', 'Windows NTLM hostname' and 'Windows NTLM domain' for 'Windows NTLM'-based authentication.

HTTP request settings:: In the 'HTTP Request Settings' you can change the properties of the HTTP requests to the
remote repository. You can append a string to the user-agent HTTP header in the 'User-agent customization' of the
request and add parameters to the requests in 'URL parameters'. Additionally you can set the timeout value for
requests in seconds in 'Connection timeout' and configure a number of 'Connection retries'. The HTTP requests
configured are applied to all requests made from the repository manager to the remote repository being proxied.


////

File Content Validation;; If set to true, the repository manager performs a lightweight check on the content of
downloaded files. This will prevent invalid content to be stored and proxied by the repository manager that
otherwise can happen in cases where the remote repository (or some proxy between the repository manager and the
remote repository) returns a HTML page instead of the requested file.

Checksum policy;; Sets the checksum policy for a remote repository. This option is set to 'Warn' by default. The
possible values of this setting are:
+
* 'Ignore' - Ignore the checksums entirely
* 'Warn' - Print a warning in the log if a checksum is not correct
+
* 'StrictIfExists' - Refuse to cache an component if the calculated checksum is inconsistent with a checksum in
the repository. Only perform this check if the checksum file is present.
+
* 'Strict' - Refuse to cache an component if the calculated checksum is inconsistent or if there is no checksum
for an component.


Allow file browsing;; When set to true, users can browse the contents of the repository with a web browser.

Include in Search;; When set to true, this repository is included when you perform a search in the repository
manager. If this setting is false, the contents of the repository are excluded from a search.

Publish URL;; If this property is set to false, the repository will not be published on a URL, and you will not be able
to access this repository remotely. You would set this configuration property to false if you want to prevent clients
for connecting to this repository directly.

Expiration Settings:: The repository manager maintains a local cache of components and metadata, you can configure
expiration parameters for a proxy repository. The expiration settings are:

Item Max Age;; Some items in a repository may be neither an artifact identified by the Maven GAV coordinates or
metadata for such components. This cache value determines the maximum age for these items before updates are
retrieved.
////

===== Configuration for Maven2 Format

Version policy:: A Maven repository can either host release components or development components. The 'Version
policy' allows you to set 'Snapshot' for development components that end up with '-SNAPSHOT' in the version
string. This allows repeated uploads where the actual number used is composed of a date/timestamp and an
enumerator and the retrieval can still use the '-SNAPSHOT' version string. The version policy can only be set,
when the repository is created and can not be changed at a later stage. Repository groups can be used to expose a
combination of release and development versions from multiple repositories.

Strict Content Type Validation:: Maven repositories can be configured to validate any new components to see if the
MIME-type corresponds to the content of the file by enabling this setting. Any files with a mismatch are rejected.

===== Configuration for NuGet Format
	
The NuGet repository format uses http://www.odata.org/[OData] queries for communication between the client and the
repository. These queries include metadata information about available packages and other data.

When the repository manager receives queries from the +nuget+ client, it passes these queries on to the remote
repositories, configured as proxy repository, if necessary.

To avoid sending identical queries to the remote repository, the repositry manager caches the queries and will
rely on previously stored metadata if the same query is received again before the cache expires.

The parameters 'Query cache size' and 'Query cache age' can be used to configure the size of this cache in terms
of how many queries are cached as well as the rate at which queries expire and are subsequently re-run.

===== Configuration for Docker Format

The Docker repository format adds configuration for 'Docker Connectors' and 'Docker Registry API Support'. More
details can be found in <<docker>>.


===== Repository Groups

The creation and configuration for a repository group differs a little from pure repositories. It allows you to
manage the member repositories of a repository group. An example for a repository group using the 'maven2' format
is visible in <<fig-group-config>>. In this figure you can see the contents of the 'maven-public' group that is
pre-configured in {pro}.

[[fig-group-config]]
.Repository Group Configuration
image::figs/web/admin-repository-repositories-group.png[scale=50]

The 'Format' and 'Type' are determined by the selection of the provider in the creation dialog e.g., 'maven2
(group)' for the 'maven-public' as a 'maven2' format repository group.

The 'Name' is set during the creation and is fixed once the repository group is created.

The 'Online' checkbox allows you set whether this repository group is available to client side tools or not.

The 'Member repositories' selector allows you to add repositories to the repository group as well as remove
them. The 'Members' column includes all the repositories that constitute the group. The 'Available' column
includes all the repositories and repository groups that can potentially be added to the group.

Note that the order of the repositories listed in the 'Member' section is important. When the repository manager
searches for a component in a repository group, it will return the first match. To reorder a repository in this
list, click and the drag the repositories and groups in the 'Members' list or use the arrow buttons between the
'Available' and 'Members' list. These arrows can be used to add and remove repositories as well.

The order of repositories or other groups in a group can be used to influence the effective metadata that will be
retrieved by Maven or other tools from a repository group. We recommend placing hosted repositories higher in the
list than proxy repositories. For proxy repositories, the repository manager needs to check the remote repository
which will incur more overhead than a hosted repository lookup.

We also recommend placing repositories with a higher probability of matching the majority of components higher in
this list. If most of your components are going to be retrieved from the Central Repository, putting
'maven-central' higher in this list than a smaller, more focused repository is going to be better for performance,
as the repository manager is not going to interrogate the smaller remote repository for as many missing
components. These best practices are implemented in the default configuration.

==== Repository Management Example

The following sections detail some common steps of your repository management efforts on the example of a 'maven2'
repository.

[[config-sect-custom]]  
===== Adding Repositories for Missing Dependencies

If you've configured your Maven +settings.xml+ or other build tool configuration to use the +maven-public+
repository group as a mirror for all repositories, you might encounter projects that are unable to retrieve
components from your local repository manager installation.

TIP:: More details about client tool configuration for Maven repositories can be found in <<maven>>.

This usually happens because you are trying to build a project that has defined a custom set of repositories and
snapshot repositories or relies on the content of other publicly available repositories in its configuration. When
you encounter such a project all you have to do is

* add this repository as a new 'maven2' format, proxy repository
* and then add the new proxy repository to the 'maven-public' group.

The advantage of this approach is that no configuration change on the build tool side is necessary at all.

[[config-sect-new-repo]]
===== Adding a New Repository

Once you have established the URL and format of the remote repository you are ready to configure the
repository. E.g. the JBoss.org releases repository contains your missing component. Click on the 'Create
repository' button in the 'Repositories' feature view and click on 'maven2 (proxy)' from the list in the dialog.

In the configuration dialog:

* Set 'Name' to +jboss-releases+
* Set 'Remote storage' to +https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/releases/+
* For a 'maven2' format repository, confirm that the 'Version policy' is set correctly to 'Release'.
* Click on the 'Create repository' button at the end of the form

The repository manager is now configured to proxy the repository. If the remote repository contains snapshots as
well as release components, you will need to repeat the process creating a second proxy repository with the same
URL setting version policy to 'Snapshot'.

[[config-sect-repo-group]]  
===== Adding a Repository to a Group

Next you will need to add the new repository 'jboss-releases' to the 'maven-public' repository group. To do this,
click on the row of the 'maven-public' group in the 'Repositories' feature view.

To add the new repository to the public group, find the repository in the 'Available' list on the left, click on
the repository you want to add and drag it to the right to the 'Members' list. Once the repository is in that
list, you can click and drag the repository within that list to alter the order in which the group will be
searched for a matching component. Press the 'Save' button to complete this configuration.

In the last few sections, you learned how to add new repositories to a build in order to download components that
are not available in the Central Repository.

If you were not using a repository manager, you would have added these repositories to the repository element of
your project's POM, or you would have asked all of your developers to modify +~/.m2/settings.xml+ to reference two
new repositories. Instead, you used the repository manager to add the two repositories to the public group. If all
of the developers are configured to point to the public group, you can freely swap in new repositories without
asking your developers to change local configuration, and you've gained a certain amount of control over which
repositories are made available to your development team. In addition the performance of the component resolving
across multiple repositories will be handled by the repository manager and therefore be much faster than client
side resolution done by Maven each time.

[[admin-support]]
=== Support Features

{pro} and {oss} provides a number of features that allow you to ensure your server is configured correctly and
provides you with tools to investigate details about the configuration. This information can be useful for
troubleshooting and support activities.

All support features are available in the 'Support' group of the 'Administration' menu in the main menu section
and include:

* <<admin-support-analytics,Analytics>>
* <<admin-support-logging,Logging and Log Viewer>>
* <<admin-support-metrics,Metrics>>
* <<admin-support-supportzip,Support ZIP>>
* <<admin-support-systeminformation,System Information>>


[[admin-support-analytics]]
==== Analytics
{inall}

The analytics integration allows Sonatype to gather data about of your repository manager usage, since it enables
the collection of event data. It collects non-sensitive information about how you are using the repository manager
and allows Sonatype to achieve a better understanding of usage overall and therefore drive product innovation
following your needs.

The collected information is limited the primary interaction points between your environment and the repository
manager. None of the request specific data (e.g., credentials or otherwise sensitive information) is ever
captured.

TIP: The data is can be useful to you from a compatibility perspective, since it gathers answers to questions such
as what features are most important, where are users having difficulties, and what integrations/APIs are actively
in use.

You can enable the event logging in the 'Analytics' feature view available via 'Analytics' menu item in the
'Support' section of the 'Administration' menu. Select the checkbox beside 'Collect analytics events' and press
the 'Save' button.

You can choose to provide this data automatically to Sonatype by selecting the checkbox beside 'Enable anonymized
analytics submission to Sonatype'. It enables Sonatype to tailor the ongoing development of the
product. Alternatively, you can submit the data manually or just use the gathered data for your own analysis only.

Once enabled, all events logged can be inspected in the 'Events' feature view available via the 'Analytics'
section of the 'Administration' menu displayed in <<fig-analytics-events>>.

[[fig-analytics-events]]
.List of Analytics Events
image::figs/web/analytics-events.png[scale=50]

The list of events shows the 'Event type', the 'Timestamp', the 'Sequence' number and the 'Duration' of the event
as well as the 'User' that triggered it and any 'Attributes'. Each row has a '+' symbol in the first column that
allows you to expand the row vertically. Each attribute will be expanded into a separate line allowing you to
inspect all the information that is potentially submitted to Sonatype.

The 'User' value is replaced by a salted hash so that no username information is transmitted. The 'Anonymization
Salt' is automatically randomly generated and can optionally be configured in the 'Analytics: Collection'
capability manually. This administration area can additionally be used to change the random identifier for the
repository manager instance.

TIP: More information about capabilities can be found in <<admin-system-capabilities>>.

If you desire to further inspect the data that is potentially submitted, you can select to download the file
containing the JSON files in a zip archive by clicking the 'Export' button above the events list and downloading
the file. The 'Submit' button can be used to manually submit the events to Sonatype.

IMPORTANT: Sonatype values your input greatly and hopes you will activate the analytics feature and the automatic
submission to allow us to ensure ongoing development is well aligned with your needs. In addition, we appreciate
any further direct contact and feedback in person and look forward to hearing from you.

[[admin-support-logging]]
==== Logging and Log Viewer
{inall}

You can configure the level of logging for the repository manager and all plugins as well as inspect the current
log using the user interface with the 'Logging' and the 'Log Viewer' feature views.

Access the 'Logging' feature view displayed in <<fig-logging>> with the 'Logging' menu item in the 'Support'
section in the 'Administration' main menu.

[[fig-logging]]
.The Logging Feature View for Configuring Loggers
image::figs/web/logging.png[scale=60]

The 'Logging' feature view allows you to configure the preconfigured loggers as well as add and remove loggers. You can
modify the log level for a configured logger by clicking on the 'Level' value e.g., +INFO+. It will change into a
drop-down of the valid levels including +OFF+, +DEFAULT+, +INFO+ and others. Press the 'Update' button to apply the
change.

The 'Create logger' button can be used to create new loggers. You will need to know the 'Logger name' you want to
configure. Typically this corresponds to the Java package name used in the source code. Depending on your needs you can
inspect the source of {oss} and the plugins as well as the source of your own plugins to determine the related loggers
or contact Sonatype support for detailed help.

If you select a row in the list of loggers, you can delete the highlighted logger by pressing the 'Delete logger' button
above the list. This only applies to previously created custom loggers. To disable a default configured logger, set it
to `OFF`.

IMPORTANT: When upgrading the repository manager, keep in mind that some loggers change between versions, so if
you rely on specific loggers, you might have to reconfigure them.

The 'Reset to default levels' button allows you to remove all your custom loggers and get back to the setup
shipped with a fresh install of the repository manager.

The loggers configured in the user interface are persisted into +$data-dir/etc/logback-overrides.xml+ and
override any logging levels configured in the main log file +logback-nexus.xml+ as well as the other +logback-*+
files. If you need to edit a logging level in those files, we suggest to edit the overrides file. This will give
you access to edit the configuration in the user interface at a later stage and also ensure that the values you
configure take precedence.

The 'ROOT' logger level controls how verbose the logging is in general. If set to +DEBUG+, logging will be very
verbose, printing all log messages including debugging statements. If set to +ERROR+, logging will be far less
verbose, only printing out a log statement if the repository manager encounters an error. +INFO+ represents an
intermediate amount of logging.

TIP: When configuring logging, keep in mind that heavy logging can have a significant performance impact on an
application and any changes trigger the change to the logging immediately.

Once logging is configured as desired, you can inspect the impact of your configuration in the 'Log Viewer'
feature view. It allows you to copy the log from the server to your machine by pressing the 'Download' button. The
'Create mark' button allows you to add a custom text string into the log, so that you can create a reference point
in the log file for an analysis of the file. It will insert the text you entered surrounded by +*+ symbols as
visible in <<fig-log-viewer>>.

[[fig-log-viewer]]
.Viewing the Log with an Inserted Mark
image::figs/web/log-viewer.png[scale=50]

The 'Refresh interval' configuration on the right on the top of the view allows you to configure the timing for
the refresh as well as the size of the log displayed. A manual refresh can be triggered with the general refresh
button in the main toolbar.


[[admin-support-metrics]]
==== Metrics
{inall}

The 'Metrics' feature view is available in the 'Support' section of the 'Administration' main menu. It provides
insight to characteristics of the Java virtual machine JVM running the repository manager and is displayed in
<<fig-metrics>>.

[[fig-metrics]]
.JVM Metrics
image::figs/web/metrics.png[scale=40]

The 'Memory usage', 'Memory distribution' and 'Thread states' charts provide some simple visualizations. The
'Download' button allows you to retrieve a large number of properties from the JVM and download them in a
JSON-formatted text file. Pressing the 'Thread dump' button triggers the creation of a thread dump of the JVM and
a download of the resulting text file.

////
==== Support Request

tbd

////

[[admin-support-supportzip]]
==== Support ZIP
{inall}

The 'Support ZIP' feature view allows you to create a ZIP archive file that you can submit to Sonatype support via email
or a support ticket. The checkboxes in 'Contents' and 'Options' allow you to control the content of the archive.

You can include the 'System information report' as available in the 'System Information' tab, a 'JVM thread-dump'
of the JVM currently running the repository, your general 'Configuration files' as well as you 'Security
configuration files', the 'Log files' and 'System and component metrics' with network and request-related
information and 'JMX information'.

The 'Options' allow you to limit the size of the included files as well as the overall ZIP archive file size. Pressing
the 'Create support ZIP' button gathers all files, creates the archive in `$data-dir/downloads` and opens a
dialog to download the file to your workstation. This dialog shows the 'Name', 'Size' and exact 'Path' of the support
ZIP file.

[[admin-support-systeminformation]]
==== System Information
{inall}

The 'System Information' feature view displays a large number of configuration details related to

Nexus:: details about the versions of the repository manager and the installed plugins, install and work directory
location, application host and port and a number of other properties.

Java Virtual Machine:: all system properties like +java.runtime.name+, +os.name+ and many more as known by the JVM
running the repository manager

Operating System:: including environment variables like +JAVA_HOME+ or +PATH+ as well as details about the runtime in
terms of processor, memory and threads, network connectors and storage file stores.

You can copy a subsection of the text from the panel or use the 'Download' button to retrieve a JSON-formatted text
file.
