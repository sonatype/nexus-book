[[confignx]]
== Configuring {pro}

Many of the configuration screens shown in this section are only available to administrative users. {pro} allows
the admin user to customize the list of repositories, create repository groups, customize server settings, and
create routes or "rules" that Maven will use to include or exclude components from a repository.

[[configxn-sect-customizing-server]]
=== Customizing Server Configuration

{inall}

You can access global configuration by clicking on 'Server' under 'Administration' in the left-hand main menu. The
server configuration screens' subsections are documented in the following sections..

[[config-sect-smtp]]
==== SMTP Settings

{pro} sends email to users who need to recover user names and
passwords, notifications for staging and a number of other uses. In
order for these notifications to work, configure the SMTP server
settings in this dialog.

You can configure the 'Hostname' and 'Port' of the SMTP server to use as well as
'Username' and 'Password'. The 'Connection' configuration allows you
to configure {pro} to use plain or secure SMTP to connect to the
server or to use STARTTLS for the connection, which would upgrade the
initially established, plain connection to be encrypted. In all cases
you will need to ensure that the correct port is used.

The 'System Email' parameter defines the email address used in the +From:+ header of an email sent by the
repository manager. Typically, this would be configured as a "Do-Not-Reply" email address or a mailbox or mailing
list monitored by the administrators of the server.

Once you have configured the parameters you can use the 'Test SMTP
settings' button to confirm the configured parameters and the
successful connection to the server. You will be asked to provide an
email address that should receive a test email message. Successful
sending will be confirmed in another pop up message.

[[fig-config-administration-smtp]]
.Administration SMTP Settings

==== HTTP Request Settings

The HTTP Request Settings allow you to configure the identifier that the repository manager uses when it is making
an HTTP request. You may want to change this if it needs to use an HTTP Proxy, and the Proxy will only work if the
User Agent is set to a specific value.

You can also add extra parameters to place on a GET request to a
remote repository. You could use this to add identifying information
to requests.

The amount of time the repository manager will wait for a request to succeed when interacting with an external,
remote repository can be configured with the Request Timeout and Request Retry Attempts settings.

[[fig-config-administration-http]]
.Administration HTTP Request Settings
image::figs/web/config-administration-http.png[scale=75]

[[security-settings]]
==== Security Settings

The security settings displayed in
<<fig-config-administration-security>> allow you to activate and
prioritize security realms by adding them to the 'Selected Realms'
list on the left and placing them higher or lower on the list.

[[fig-config-administration-security]]
.Administration Security Settings
image::figs/web/config-administration-security.png[scale=60]

Effectively, this configuration determines what authentication realm is
used to grant a user access and the order the realms are used.

Xml Authenticating and Xml Authorizing Realm:: These identify the internal storage of the repository manager. It
is using XML files for storing the security details.

(Enterprise) LDAP Authentication Realm:: This realm identifies
external storage in an LDAP system with details documented in
<<ldap>>.

Crowd Realm:: This realm identifies external storage in an Atlassian
Crowd system with details documented in <<crowd>>.

Rut Auth Realm:: This realm is external authentication in any system with the user authorization passed to the
repository manager in a HTTP header field with details documented in <<rutauth>>.

The 'User Token Realm' is required for user token support documented
in <<usertoken>> and the 'NuGet API-Key Realm' is needed
for NuGet support documented in <<nuget>>.

In addition, you can enable or disable anonymous access and set the username and password for anonymous
access. The anonymous username and password are used to integrate with other realms that may need a special
username for anonymous access.  In other words, the username and password here are what we attempt to authorize
when someone makes an anonymous request. You would change the anonymous username to +guest+ if you wanted to
integrate the repository manager with Microsoft's Active Directory.

==== Application Server Settings

You can change the 'Base URL' for your repository manager installation, which is used when generating links in
emails and RSS feeds. For example, the {pro} instance for Sonatype development is at
https://repository.sonatype.org, and it makes use of this 'Base URL' field to ensure that links in emails and RSS
feeds point back to the correct public URL. Internally {pro} is running on a different port and context than the
public port 80 and root context.

If you are hosting the repository manager behind a proxy server and you want to make sure that it always uses the
specified Base URL, check the 'Force Base URL' checkbox. If the Force Base URL is not checked, the repository
manager will craft URLs in HTTP responses based on the request URL, but it will use the Base URL when it is
generating emails.

[[fig-config-administration-application-server]]
.Administration Application Server Settings
image::figs/web/config-administration-application-server.png[scale=70]

TIP: These settings are especially important if the repository manager is proxied by an external proxy server
using a different protocol like HTTPS rather than plain HTTP known to it or a different hostname like
`repository.somecompany.com` instead of an IP number only.

[[config-default-http-proxy]]
==== Default HTTP and HTTPS Proxy Settings

If your repository manager instance needs to reach public repositories like the Central Repository via a proxy
server, you can configure the connection to a proxy server for HTTP and a potentially a different for HTTPS
connection. If you do not configure a proxy for HTTPS, the HTTP proxy server settings will be used.

You can specify 'Proxy Host' and 'Proxy Port' and, optionally, the
authentication details for username, password, NT LAN Host and NT LAN
Manager Domain. In addition, you can configure a number of hosts that
can be reached directly and do not need to go through the proxy in the
'Non Proxy Host' setting. <<fig-config-administration-http-prxy>> shows
the 'Default HTTP Proxy Settings' administration interface. The HTTPS
configuration interface looks the same and is found below the HTTP
configuration.

[[fig-config-administration-http-prxy]]
.Administration Default HTTP Proxy Settings
image::figs/web/config-administration-http-proxy.png[scale=70]

TIP: This is a critical initial step for many Enterprise deployments of a repository manager, since these
environments are typically secured via a HTTP/HTTPS proxy server for all outgoing internet traffic.


==== System Notification Settings

When you proxy remote repositories that are not available all the time, the repository manager will automatically
block and unblock them during downtimes. The 'System Notification Settings' allows you define 'Email Adresses' and
roles for users that should receive notifications messages for these blocking and unblocking events.

[[fig-config-administration-system-notification]]
.Administration System Notification Settings
image::figs/web/config-administration-system-notification.png[scale=70]

==== PGP Key Server Information

{pro} uses a PGP Key Server to retrieve PGP keys when
validating component signatures. To add a new key server, enter the
URL in the 'Key Server URL' field and click on the 'Add' button. To remove
a key server, click on the URL you wish to remove from the list
and click on the 'Remove' button. Key servers are consulted in the order
that they are listed in the 'Key Server URLs' list. To reorder your key
servers, click and drag a URL in the 'Key Server URLs' list.

[[fig-config-administration-pgp-key-server]]
.Administration PGP Key Server Information
image::figs/web/config-administration-pgp-key-server.png[scale=60]

==== New Version Availability

{pro} can notify you about the availability of new versions  via the user
interface. To enable this feature, check the Enable checkbox in the
'New Version Availability' section of the server settings as
shown in <<fig-config-administration-new-version>>.

[[fig-config-administration-new-version]]

[[confignx-sect-manage-repo]]
=== Managing Repositories

{inall}

To manage repositories, log in as the administrative user and click on 'Repositories' in the 'Views/Repositories'
menu in the left-hand main menu.

{pro} provides for three different kinds of repositories: 'Proxy' Repositories, 'Hosted' repositories, and
'Virtual' repositories.

[[proxy-repository]]
==== Proxy Repository

A 'Proxy Repository' is a proxy of a remote repository.  By default, {pro} ships with the following configured
proxy repositories:

Apache Snapshots:: This repository contains snapshot releases from the
Apache Software Foundation.

Codehaus Snapshots:: This repository contains snapshot releases from
Codehaus.

Central:: This is the 'Central Repository' containing release components. Formerly known as 'Maven Central', it is
the default built-in repository for Apache Maven and directly supported in other build tools like Gradle, SBT or
Ant/Ivy. {pro} connects to the Central Repository via HTTPS using the URL `https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/`.

[[hosted-repository]]
==== Hosted Repository

A 'Hosted Repository' is a repository that is hosted by the repository manager. {pro} ships with the following
configured hosted repositories:

3rd Party:: This hosted repository should be used for third-party
dependencies not available in the public Maven repositories. Examples
of these dependencies could be commercial, proprietary libraries such
as an Oracle JDBC driver that may be referenced by your organization.

Releases:: This hosted repository is where your organization will
publish internal releases.

Snapshots:: This hosted repository is where your organization will
publish internal snapshots.

[[virtual-repository]]
==== Virtual Repository

A 'Virtual Repository' serves as an adaptor to and from different types of repositories. Currently, {pro} supports
conversion to and from Maven 1 repositories and Maven 2 repositories. In addition, you can expose any repository
format as a NuGet or OBR repository. For example, a Maven 2 repository can contain OSGi Bundles, which can be
exposed as a OSGi Bundle repository with the virtual repository Provider set to OBR.

By default it ships with a Central M1 shadow repository that exposes the Central repository in Maven 1 format.

ifdef::promo[]

<?dbhtml-include href="promo_managingRepos.html"?>
++++
endif::[]


==== Configuring Repositories

The 'Repositories' window displayed in <<fig-repo-config>> allows you to create, update and delete different
repositories with the 'Add', 'Delete' and 'Trash' button. Use the 'Refresh' button to update the displayed list of
repositories and repository groups. The 'Trash' button allows you to empy the trash folder into which deleted
components are copied, when any delete operations are performed from the user interface.

By default, the list of repositories displays the repositories configured and managed by the administrator. The
drop down on the right of the 'Trash' button allows you to switch the list of repositories and view the
repositories managed by the repository manager. There are staging repositories as documented in <<staging>> or
procurement repositories as documented in <<procure>>.

[[fig-repo-config]]
.Repository Configuration Screen for a Proxy Repository
image::figs/web/repository-manager_repository-config.png[scale=50]

The list of repositories visible in <<fig-repo-config>> allows you to
access more details for each repository by selecting a specific row
which displays some information for each repository in the following
columns: 

Repository:: the name of the repository with repository groups
displayed in bold

Type:: the type of the repository with values of proxy, hosted or
virtual for repositories or group for a repository group

Health Check:: the result counts for a repository health check as
documented in <<rhc>>

Format:: the format used for the storage in the repository with values
such as +maven2+, +nuget+, +site+ or others

Policy:: the deployment policy that applies to this repository. A
policy applies only to Maven 1 and Maven 2 formatted repositories and
allows usage of a 'Snapshot' or a 'Release' policy.

Repository Status:: the status of the repository as well as further
information about the status. For example, information about SSL
certification problems or the status of the remote repository even for
a currently disabled proxy repository

Repository Path:: the direct URL path that exposes the repository via
HTTP access and potentially allows access and directory browsing
outside of the user interface

Clicking on a colum header allows you to sort the list in ascending or
descending order based on the column data.

If you right-click on a row, you can trigger a number of
actions on the current repository, depending on the
repository type. Actions include:

Expire Cache:: expire the cache of hosted or a proxy repository or a
repository group

Rebuild Metadata:: rebuid the metadata of a hosted Maven 2 repository

Block Proxy / Allow Proxy:: toggle between allowing or blocking the
remote repository configured in a proxy repository

Put Out Of Service / Put in Service:: enable or disable the repository
service to allow changing the availability of all components in it

Repair Index / Update Index:: repair or update the index of a hosted
or proxy repository or a repository group


[[fig-repo-config-2]]
.Repository Configuration Screen for a Proxy Repository
image::figs/web/repository-manager_repository-config-2.png[scale=50]

[[fig-repo-config-hosted]]
.Repository Configuration Access Settings for a Hosted Repository
image::figs/web/repository-manager_repository-config-3.png[scale=50]

<<fig-repo-config>> and <<fig-repo-config-2>> show the repository configuration screen for a proxy repository in
the repository manager. From this screen, you can manage the settings for proxying an external repository:

Repository ID:: The repository ID is the identifier that will be used in the URL. For example, the proxy
repository for the Central Repository has an ID of +central+, this means that Maven and other tools can access the
repository directly at +http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/central+. The 'Repository ID' must be
unique in a given repository manager installation and is required.

Repository Name:: The display name for a repository is required.

Repository Type:: The type of repository (proxy, hosted, or
virtual). You can't change the type of a repository as it is selected
when you create a repository.

Provider and Format:: 'Provider' and 'Format' define in what format the repository manager exposes the repository
to external tools. Supported formats depend on the installed plugins. {oss} includes support for Maven 1, Maven 2
and Site repositories. {pro} adds support for NuGet and OBR and additional plugins can add support for P2 and P2
Update Site and other formats.

Repository Policy:: If a proxy repository has a policy of release, then
it will only access released versions from the remote repository. If a
proxy repository has a policy of snapshot, it will download snapshots
from the remote repository.

Default Storage Location:: Not editable, shown for reference. This is
the default storage location for the local cached contents of the
repository.

Override Storage Location:: You can choose to override the storage
location for a specific repository. You would do this if you were
concerned about storage and wanted to put the contents of a specific
repository (such as central) in a different location.

Remote Repository Access:: This section configures proxy repositories and how the repository manager interacts
with the remote repository, that is being proxied.

Remote Storage Location;; The 'Remote Storage Location' needs to be configured with the URL of the remote
repository, that needs to be proxied. When selecting the URL to proxy it is beneficial to avoid proxying remote
repository groups. Proxying repository groups prevents some performance optimization in terms of accessing and
retrieving the content of the remote repository. If you require components from the group that are found in
different hosted repositories on the remote repository server it is better to create multiple proxy repositories
that proxy the different hosted repositories from the remote server on your repository manager instead of simply
proxying the group.

Download Remote Indexes;; Download the index of a remote repository can be configured with this setting. If
enabled, the repository manager will download the index, if it exists, and use that for its searches as well as
serve that up to any clients that ask for the index (like m2eclipse). The default for new proxy repositories is
enabled, but all of the default repositories included have this option disabled. To change this setting for one of
the proxy repositories that ship with the repository manager, change the option, save the repository, and then
re-index the repository. Once this is done, component search will return every component available on the Maven
Central repository.

Auto Blocking Enabled;; If Auto blocking active is set to true, the repository manager will automatically block a
proxy repository if the remote repository becomes unavailable. While a proxy repository is blocked, components
will still be served to clients from a local cache, but the repository manager will not attempt to locate a
component in a remote repository. The repository manager will periodically retest the remote repository and
unblock the repository once it becomes available.

File Content Validation;; If set to true, the repository manager will perform a lightweight check on the content
of downloaded files. This will prevent invalid content to be stored and proxied by the repository manager that
otherwise can happen in cases where the remote repository (or some proxy between the repository manager and the
remote repository) returns a HTML page instead of the requested file.

Checksum Policy;; Sets the checksum policy for a remote
repository. This option is set to 'Warn' by
default. The possible values of this setting are:
+
* 'Ignore' - Ignore the checksums entirely
* 'Warn' - Print a warning in the log if a checksum is not correct
+
* 'StrictIfExists' - Refuse to cache a component if the calculated
checksum is inconsistent with a checksum in the repository. Only
perform this check if the checksum file is present.
+
* 'Strict' - Refuse to cache a component if the calculated checksum is
inconsistent or if there is no checksum for a component.

Authentication;; This section allows you to set a Username, Password,
NT LAN Host, and NT Lan Manager Domain for a remote repository.

Access Settings:: This section allows for the detailed configuration
of access to a repository.

Deployment Policy;; This setting controls how a Hosted repository
allows or disallows component deployment. If this policy is set
to 'Read Only', no deployment is allowed. If this policy is
set to 'Disable Redeploy', a client can only deploy a
particular component once and any attempt to redeploy an
component will result in an error. If this policy is set to
'Allow Redeploy', clients can deploy components to this
repository and overwrite the same component in subsequent
deployments. This option is visible for hosted repositories as
shown in <<fig-repo-config-hosted>>.

Allow File Browsing;; When set to true, users can browse the contents
of the repository with a web browser.

Include in Search;; When set to true, this repository is included when you perform a search in the repository
manager. If this setting is false, the contents of the repository are excluded from a search.

Publish URL;; If this property is set to false, the repository will
not be published on a URL, and you will not be able to access
this repository remotely. You would set this configuration
property to false if you want to prevent clients for
connecting to this repository directly.

Expiration Settings:: The repository manager maintains a local cache of components and metadata, you can configure
expiration parameters for a proxy repository. The expiration settings are:

Not Found Cache TTL;; If the repository manager fails to locate a component, it will cache this result for a given
number of minutes. In other words, if the repository manager can't find a component in a remote repository, it
will not perform repeated attempts to resolve this component until the 'Not Found Cache TTL' time has been
exceeded. The default for this setting is 1440 minutes (or 24 hours).

Artifact Max Age;; Tells the repository manager what that maximum age of a component is, before it retrieves a new
version from the remote repository.  The default for this setting is -1 for a repository with a release policy and
1440 for a repository with snapshot policy.

Metadata Max Age;; The repository manager retrieves metadata from the remote repository. It will only retrieve
updates to metadata after the 'Metadata Max Age' has been exceeded. The default value for this setting is 1440
minutes (or 24 hours).

Item Max Age;; Some items in a repository may be neither a component
identified by the Maven GAV coordinates or metadata for such components. This
cache value determines the maximum age for these items before
updates are retrieved. 

HTTP Request Settings:: In the 'HTTP Request Settings' you can change the properties of the HTTP request to the
remote repository. You can also configure the 'User Agent' of the request, add parameters to a request, and set
the timeout and retry behavior. The HTTP request configured is the request made from the repository manager to the
remote repository being proxied.

Beyond these configurations in the user interface, {oss} supports the usage of cookies for remote repositories
authentication. Together with the feature to enable circular redirects, this enables proxying repositories like
the Oracle Maven repository. The following configuration can be added to +nexus.properties+ and allows a
functioning proxy repository to the URL +https://maven.oracle.com+.

----
# Comma separated list of hostnames that needs to accept circular redirections
nexus.remoteStorage.enableCircularRedirectsForHosts=maven.oracle.com
# Comma separated list of hostnames that benefit from using cookies
nexus.remoteStorage.useCookiesForHosts=maven.oracle.com
----


==== Viewing the Summary Panel for a Repository

The 'Summary' panel can be loaded by selecting a hosted, proxy, or
virtual repository and then clicking on the 'Summary'
tab. The 'Summary' tab of a hosted repository, as shown
in <<fig-configuring-summary-hosted>>, displays the
+distributionManagement+ settings that can be used to configure
Maven to publish components to the hosted repository.

[[fig-configuring-summary-hosted]]

The 'Summary' panel for a proxy repository, as shown in
<<fig-configuring-summary-proxy>>, contains all of the repository
identifiers and configuration as well as a list of groups in which
the repository is contained.

==== Auto Block/Unblock of Remote Repositories

What happens when the repository manager is unable to reach a remote repository? If you've defined a proxy
repository and the remote repository is unavailable, the repository manager will now automatically block the
remote repository.  Once a repository has been auto-blocked, the repository manager will then periodically retest
the remote repository and unblock the repository once it becomes available. You can control this behavior by
changing the 'Auto Blocking Enabled' setting under the 'Remote Repository Access' section of the proxy repository
configuration as shown in the following figure to 'True':

.Configuring Remote Repository Auto Block/Unblock
image::figs/web/configuring_auto-block.png[scale=75]

[[repository-groups]]
=== Managing Repository Groups

{inall}


Repository groups are a powerful feature of {pro}. They allow you to combine
multiple repositories and other repository groups of the same
repository format in a single repository group. This single group and
the associated URL can then be used as a single access point to all
components in a specific format sourced from an number of repositories.

This eases the configuration for the users and at the same time allows
the adminstrators to add more repositories and therefore
components without requiring changes on the client computers.

Use the left-hand panel 'Repositories' menu item in the 'Views/Repositories'
menu to access the repositories and groups management interface.

To create a new repository group, press the 'Add' button above the
repository list and select 'Repository Group'. In the
configuration tab provide a 'Group ID' and 'Group Name'. The 'Group
ID' will be part of the URL to the repository group and should
therefore use a limited set of characters and not contain
spaces. Ideally use only lowercase letters and numbers and characters like '-'.

The selection of the 'Provider' determines the repository 'Format' and
therefore the list of 'Available Repositories' automatically. To add
repositories to the repository group, drag them to the 'Ordered Group
Repositories' or use the arrows between the two lists. 

[[fig-group-config]]
.Group Configuration Screen
image::figs/web/repository-manager_add-to-group.png[scale=50]

Note that the order of the repositories listed in 'Ordered Group Repositories' is important. When the repository
manager searches for a component in a group, it will return the first match. To reorder a repository in this list,
click and the drag the repositories and groups in the 'Ordered Group Repositories' selection list.

The order of repositories or other groups in a group can be used to influence the effective metadata that will be
retrieved from a repository group. We recommend placing hosted repositories higher in the list than proxy
repositories within the list. For proxy repositories the repository manager needs to periodically check the remote
for updates, which will incur more overhead than a hosted repository lookup.

We also recommend placing repositories with a higher probability of matching the majority of components higher in
this list. If most of your components are going to be retrieved from the Central Repository, putting 'Central'
higher in this list than a smaller, more focused repository is going to be better for performance, as the
repository manager is not going to interrogate the smaller remote repository for as many missing components.

Once a repository group is configured it can be used from the client
as discussed in e.g. <<config-maven>>, <<npm-configuring>>,
<<rubygems-configuring>> or <<nuget-configuring>> and further
repositories can be added easily.

{pro} ships with one group: +public+. The Public Repositories group uses the Maven 2 repository format and
combines the important external Central Repository with the hosted repositories: 3rd Party, Releases, and
Snapshots.

In <<config-maven>> we configured Maven via the settings.xml to look for components in the public group managed by
the repository manager. <<fig-group-config>> shows the group configuration screen in the user interface. In this
figure you can see the contents of the 'Public Repositories' group.

[[confignx-sect-managing-routes]]
=== Managing Routing

{inall}

Routing can be considered the internal activities the repository manager performs in order to determine where to
look for a specific component in a repository. The routing information has an impact on the performance of
component retrieval as well as determining the availability of components.

A large portion of the performance gains achievable with correct and optimized routing information is configured
by the repository manager itself with automatic routing, documented in <<automatic-routing>>. Fine grained control
and further customizations in terms of access provision can be achieved with some manual routing configuration
documented in <<manual-routing>>.

[[automatic-routing]]
==== Automatic Routing

Automatic routing is handled on a per repository
basis. You can access the configuration and further details in the
Routing tab after selecting a repository in the list accessible via the
'Repositories' item in the 'Views/Repositories' left-hand menu.

The routing information consists of the top two levels of the directory structure of the repository and is stored
in a prefixes.txt file. It allows the repository manager to automatically route only component requests with the
corresponding `groupId` values to a repository, as found in the text file. This, in turns, avoids unnecessary index
or even remote repository access and therefore greatly improves performance.

The repository manager generates the prefixes.txt file for a hosted repository and makes it available for remote
downloads. Each deployment of a new component will trigger an update of the file for the hosted repository as well
as the prefix files for any repository groups that contain the hosted repository. You can access it in the
'Routing' tab of a hosted repository as displayed in <<fig-automatic-routing-hosted>> by clicking on the 'Show
prefix file' link on the right. In addition, the 'Publishing' section shows the 'Status' of the routing
information, a 'Message' with further details, and the date and time of the last update in the 'Published On'
field.

[[fig-automatic-routing-hosted]]
.Automatic Routing for a Hosted Repository
image::figs/web/automatic-routing-hosted.png[scale=60]

The 'Routing' tab for a proxy repository displayed in
<<fig-automatic-routing-proxy>> contains the Discovery section. It
displays the 'Status' and a more detailed 'Message' about the prefix
file access. The 'Last run' field displays the date and time of the
last execution of the prefix file discovery. Such an execution can be
triggered by pressing the 'Update now' button. Otherwise, the 'Update
Interval' allows you to trigger a new discovery every one, two, three,
six, nine or twelve hours or as a daily or weekly execution. 

[[fig-automatic-routing-proxy]]
.Automatic Routing for a Proxy Repository
image::figs/web/automatic-routing-proxy.png[scale=60]

For a proxy repository, the prefix file is either downloaded from the remote repository or generation is attempted
by scraping the HTML directory listing of the remote repository. If a prefix file is published by the remote it is
always used. The scraping strategy only used in cases where the repository manager can be sure the remote
directory listing contains all available artifacts. For example, if the remote is hosted repository on a {pro}, or
a well known format such as a Subversion based repository then the directory listing will be used if no prefix
file is available.

The generation of the prefix file in all the repository managers deployments proxying each other greatly improves
performance for all repository manager instances. It lowers network traffic and load on the servers, since failing
requests and serving the respective HTTP error pages for a component that is not found is avoided for each
component. Instead, the regularly light weight download of the prefix file establishes a good high-level knowledge
of components available.

Automatic Routing is configured automatically brings significant performance benefits to all {pro} and {oss}
instances proxying each other in a network and on the wider internet. It does not need to be changed apart from
tweaking the update interval. To exercise even finer control than provided by Automatic Routing use Routing as
documented in <<manual-routing>>.

[[manual-routing]]
==== Manual Routing Configuration

Routes are like filters you can apply to groups in terms
of security access and general component retrieval, and can reduce the
number of repositories within a group accessed in order to retrieve an
component. The administration interface for routes can be accessed via
the 'Routing' menu item in the 'View/Repositories' menu in the left-hand
navigation panel.

Routes allow you to configure the repository manager to include or exclude specific repository content paths from
a particular component search when the repository manager is trying to locate a component in a repository
group. There are a number of different scenarios in which you might configure a route.

The most commonly configured scenario is when you want to make sure
that you are retrieving components in a particular group ID from a
particular repository. This is especially useful when you want your
own organization's components from the hosted Release and Snapshot
repositories only.

Routes are applicable when you are trying to resolve a component from a repository group. Using routes allows you
to modify the repositories the repository manager consults when it tries to resolve a component from a group of
repositories.

[[fig-route-config]]
.Routing Configuration Screen
image::figs/web/repository-manager_route-config.png[scale=60]

<<fig-route-config>> shows the 'Routing' configuration
screen. Clicking on a route will bring up a screen that will allow
you to configure the properties of a route. The configuration options
available for a route are:

URL Pattern:: The repository manager uses the 'URL Pattern' will use to match a request. If the regular expression
    in this pattern is matched, the repository manager will either include or exclude the listed repositories from
    a particular component query. In <<fig-route-config>> the two patterns are:

    `^/(com|org)/somecompany/.*`;; This pattern would match all
    paths that start with either `/com/somecompany/` or
    `/org/somecompany/`. The expression in the parenthesis matches
    either com or org, and the +.*+ matches zero or more
    characters. You would use a route like this to match your own
    organization's components and map these requests to the hosted
    Releases and Snapshots repositories.

    `^/org/some-oss/.*`;; This pattern is used in an exclusive route. It matches every path that starts with
    `/org/some-oss/`. This particular exclusive route excludes the local hosted Releases and Snapshots directory
    for all components that match this path.  When the repository manager tries to resolve components that match
    this path, it will exclude the Releases and Snapshots repositories.

    `(?!/org/some-oss/.*).*`;; Using this pattern in an
    exclusive route allows you to exclude everything, except the
    "org/some-oss" project(s). It uses a special negative matching regular expression.

Rule Type:: Rule Type can be either 'inclusive', 'exclusive' or 'blocking'. An
inclusive rule type defines the set of repositories that should be
searched for components when the URL pattern has been matched. An
exclusive rule type defines repositories which should not be searched
for a particular component. A blocking rule will completely remove
accessibility to the components under the specific pattern in a
specified repository group.

Ordered Route Repositories:: The repository manager searches an ordered list of repositories to locate a
particular component.  This order only affects the order of routes used and not the order of the repositories
searched. That order is set by the order of the repositories in the group repository's configuration.

In <<fig-route-config>> you can see the two dummy routes that are configured as default routes. The first route is
an inclusive route, and it is provided as an example of a custom route an organization might use to make sure that
internally generated components are resolved from the Releases and Snapshots repositories only. If your
organization's group IDs all start with +com.somecompany+, and if you deploy internally generated components to
the Releases and Snapshots repositories, this Route will make sure that the repository manager doesn't waste time
trying to resolve these components from public repositories like the Central Repository or the Apache Snapshots
repository.

The second dummy route is an exclusive route. This route excludes the Releases and Snapshots repositories when the
request path contains +/org/some-oss+. This example might make more sense if we replaced +some-oss+ with +apache+
or +codehaus+. If the pattern was +/org/apache+, this rule is telling the repository manager to exclude the
internal Releases and Snapshots repositories when it is trying to resolve these dependencies. In other words,
don't bother looking for an Apache dependency in your organization's internal repositories.

TIP: Exclusive rules will positively impact performance, since the
number of repositories that qualify for locating the component, and
therefore the search effort is reduced.

What if there is a conflict between two routes? The repository manager will process inclusive routes before it
will process the exclusive routes.  Remember that routes only affect the repository managers resolution of
components when it is searching a Group. When it starts to resolve a component from a repository group it will
start with the list of repositories in a group. If there are matching inclusive routes, the repository manager
will then take the intersection of the repositories in the group and the repositories in the inclusive route. The
order as defined in the group will not be affected by the inclusive route. The repository manager will then take
the result of applying the inclusive route and apply the exclusive route to that list of repositories. The
resulting list is then searched for a matching component.

One straightforward use of routes is to create a route that excludes the Central Repository from all searches for
your own organization's hosted components. If you are deploying your own components to the repository manager
under a groupId of +org.mycompany+, and if you are not deploying these components to a public repository, you can
create a rule that tells the repository manager not to interrogate Central for your own organization's
components. This will improve performance because the repository manager will not need to communicate with a
remote repository when it serves your own organization's components. In addition to the performance benefits,
excluding the Central Repository from searches for your own components will reduce needless queries to the public
repositories.

TIP: This practice of defining an inclusive route for your internal components to only hit internal repositories
is a crucial best practice of implementing a secure component management in your organization and a recommended
step for initial configuration of the repository manager. Without this configuration, requests for internal
components will be broadcasted to all configured external proxy repositories. This could lead to an information
leak, where e.g., your internet traffic reveals that your organization works on a component with the component
coordinates of `com.example.website:secret-feature:1.0`.


In addition to defining inclusive and exclusive routes, you can define
blocking routes. A blocking route can be created by creating a route
with no repositories in the ordered list of repositories. It allows
you to completely block access to components with the specified
pattern(s) from the group. As such, blocking routes are a simplified,
coarse-grained access control.

TIP: Check out <<procure>> for fine-grained control of component
availability and use blocking routes sparingly.


To summarize, there are creative possibilities with routes that the designers of {pro} may not have anticipated,
but we advise you to proceed with caution if you start relying on conflicting or overlapping routes.  Use routes
sparingly, and use coarse URL patterns. Remember that routes are only applied to groups and are not used when a
component is requested from a specific repository.

[[scheduled-tasks]]
=== Managing Scheduled Tasks

{inall}

The repository managerss allows you to schedule tasks that will be applied to all repositories or to specific
repositories on a configurable schedule. Use the 'Scheduled Tasks' menu item in the 'Administration' menu to
access the screen, shown in <<fig-repomap-scheduled>>, that allows you to manage your Scheduled Tasks.

[[fig-repomap-scheduled]]
.Managing Scheduled Tasks
image::figs/web/repository-manager_schedule-service.png[scale=50]

The list interface allows you to 'Add' new tasks and 'Run', 'Cancel', and
'Delete' existing tasks as well as 'Refresh' the list with respective
buttons above the list.

When creating or updating a scheduled task, you can configure the
following properties:

Enabled:: Enable or disable a specific task.

Name:: Provide a name to identify the task in the user interface and
log files.

Task Type:: Specify the type of action the scheduled task
executes. The list of available task types is documented in more
detail below.

Task Settings:: Configure the task settings specific to the selected task
type. Tasks affecting a repository have a setting called
'Repository/Group' that allows you to let the task affect all
repositories and groups or only a specific one.

Alert Email:: Configure a notification email for task execution
failures. If a scheduled task fails a notification email containing
the task identifier and name as well as the stack trace of the failure
will be sent to the configured email recipient. 

Recurrence:: Configure the schedule for the task executions. Available
choices are Manual, Once, Hourly, Daily, Weekly, Monthly and
Advanced. All choices provide a custom user interface
for scheduling the specific recurrence. Weekly scheduling requires at
least one day of the week to be selected. The Advanced setting allows
you to provide a CRON expression to configure more complex
schedules.

The following kinds of scheduled task types are available:

Backup All Configuration Files:: This scheduled task will
archive the contents of the +sonatype-work/nexus/conf+ directory.
Once a backup has been run, the contents of the backup will be
available in +sonatype-work/nexus/backup+ in a series of ZIP archives
that use a datetimestamp in the filename. This task is a feature of
{pro}.

Backup npm metadata database:: A backup archive of the npm metadata database 
is created in the +sonatype-work/nexus/backup/npm+ with a date and time stamp 
in the filename. This backup is intended to be used for disaster recovery 
in case the npm metadata database got corrupted. 

Delete npm metadata:: This task allows you to completely delete the npm metadata 
of a npm repository and should be only run manually upon advice from Sonatype support.

Download Indexes:: This scheduled task causes the repository manager to download indexes from remote repositories
for proxied repositories. The Download Remote Indexes configuration also needs to be enabled on the proxy
repository.

Download NuGet Feed:: This task allowed you to download the feed for a NuGet proxy repository. It should not be
used any longer, since it has negative impacts on the performance of your {pro} or {oss} as well as
Nuget.org. With {pro} 2.11.3+ it has been changed to perform no operation at all to avoid this problem. It is safe
to remove any executions of this task.

Drop Inactive Staging Repositories:: Staging repositories can be
dropped by user interaction or automated systems using the Nexus
Staging Maven Plugin or Ant Task or a REST API call. Heavy users of
the repository manager staging features observe that some staging and build
promotion repositories are inevitably left behind. This scheduled
task can be used to drop all these repositories.  You can configure
the duration of inactivity to include the days after the repositories
are dropped as well as the status of the repositories. Any change of
the staging repository like a state change from open to closed to
promoted or released as well other changes to the repository meta data
like a description update are counted as an activity. You can
configure to 'Scan open repositories', 'Scan closed repositories',
'Scan promoted repositories' and 'Scan released repositories' for
inactivity and therefore potentially drop them with this task. This
will allow you to avoid accumulating a large number of stale staging
repositories.

Empty Trash:: The Evict and Purge actions do not delete data from the repository manager working directory. They
simply move data to be cleared or evicted to a trash directory under the work directory. This task deletes the
data in this trash directory older than the number of days specified in the task setting 'Purge items older than
(days)'.

Evict Unused Proxied Items From Repository Caches:: This scheduled task tells the repository manager to delete all
proxied items that haven't been "used" (referenced or retrieved by a client) in a number of days as specified in
'Evict items older than (days)'. This can be a good job to run if you are trying to conserve storage space and do
not need all of the components in the future e.g., to reproduce old builds without renewed retrieval. This is
particularly useful for a personal repository manager deployment with a large change rate of components combined
with limited diskspace.

Expire Repository Caches:: Repositories have several caches to improve performance. This task expires the caches
causing the repository manager to recheck the remote repository for a proxy repository or the file system for a
hosted repository. You can configure the repository or group to be affected with the task setting
'Repository/Group'. Additionally you can provide a Repository Path to configure the content that should be
expired.

Mirror Eclipse Update Site:: The P2 plugin
allows you to mirror Eclipse update sites. This task can be used to
force updates of repositories that went out of sync.

Optimize Repository Index:: To speed up searches in the repository manager, this task tells the internal search
engine to optimize its index files. This has no affect on the indexes published by the repository
manager. Typically, this task does not have to run more than once a week.

Publish Indexes:: Just as Maven downloads an index from a remote repository, the repository manager can publish an
index in the same format. This will make it easier for people using m2eclipse or {pro} to interact with your
repositories.

Purge Nexus Timeline:: The repository manager maintains a lot of data that relates to the interaction between
itself, proxied remote repositories, and clients.  While this information can be important for purposes of
auditing, it can also take up storage space. Using this scheduled task you can tell the repository manager to
periodically purge this information. The setting "Purge Items older than (days)" controls the age of the data to
be deleted.

Purge Orphaned API Keys:: This scheduled tasks will delete old, unused API keys generated and used by various
plugins. For example, it should be scheduled when using the User Token feature or NuGet repositories. It will
purge orphaned API keys e.g., after users reset their token and should be scheduled to run regularly, specifically
when internal security policies for password resets and you are using an external security provider like LDAP with
this requirement for resets to access the repository manager.

Rebuild Maven Metadata Files:: This task will rebuild the
maven-metadata.xml files with the correct information and will also
validate the checksums (.mh5/.sha1) for all files in the specified
Repository/Group. Typically this task is run manually to repair a
corrupted repository.

Rebuild NuGet Feed:: If you are using NuGet, pushing your components
into a NuGet hosted repository and are proxying that repository to
other users, this task can be used to rebuild the feed.
 
Rebuild P2 metadata and Rebuild P2 repository:: These tasks can be
used to rebuild the metadata or the full repository with a P2
format. You can specify a Repository/Group or a Repository Path to
determine which content to affect.

Rebuild hosted npm metadata:: The npm metadata for a hosted repository 
can be rebuilt based on the components found in the storage of a hosted 
repository. The task can serve as a recovery tool in cases where the 
npm metadata database got corrupted or the component storage was created 
manually or via some external process like e.g. an rsync copying.

Reconcile Repository Checksums:: This task was used to repair checksums 
and should only be used upon specific advise from Sonatype support.

Remove Releases From Repository:: In many use cases of a repository
manager, it is necessary to keep release components for long periods
of time or forever. This can be necessary for reproducibility reasons,
in order to ensure users have access to old versions or even just for
audit or legal reasons. However, in other use cases, there is no value
in keeping old release components. One example would be a when using a
continuous delivery approach onto a single deployment platform with no
roll back support. In other cases, it could also be impractical due to
the mere number and size of the release components.
+ 
This scheduled task allows you to trigger the deletion of release
components, supporting these use cases taking care of meta data
updates, and removing the need to manually delete the components or use
an external system to trigger the deletion.
+ 
To configure the task, you specify the repository where release
components are to be deleted as well as the number of component
versions to keep for a specific groupId and artifactId coordinate. The
task generates a list of all versions of a component for each groupId
and artifactId coordinate combination and sorts it according to the
version number. The ordering is derived by parsing the version string
and supports http://semver.org[sematic versioning] with additional
semantics for specific classifiers. Further details can be
found in the documentation for the implementing class
http://sonatype.github.io/sonatype-aether/apidocs/org/sonatype/aether/util/version/GenericVersionScheme.html[GenericVersionScheme].
+
Optionally, the 'Repository Target' parameter can be used to narrow
down the content of the repository that is analyzed, to determine if
any deletion should occur. Choosing +All(Maven2)+ is suitable to cause
all Maven 2-formatted repositories to be analysed. If you want to only
target a specific groupId and artifactId combination or a number of
them you can create a suitable repository target as documented in
<<repository-targets>> and use it in the
configuration of the scheduled task.
 
Remove Snapshots from Repository:: Often, you will want to remove
snapshots from a snapshot repository to preserve storage space. This
task supports this deletion for time stamped snapshots as created by
Maven 3.x in a deployment repository. Note that configuring and
running this job is not enough to reclaim disk space.  You will also
need to configure a scheduled job to empty the trash folder.  Files
are not deleted by the 'Remove Snapshots' job. They are only moved into
the trash folder.  When you create a scheduled task to remove
snapshots, you can specify the 'Repository/Group' to affect as well as:
+
'Minimum snapshot count';; This configuration option allows you to specify a minimum number of snapshots to
preserve per component.  For example, if you configured this option with a value of 2, the repository manager will
always preserve at least two snapshot components. A value of -1 indicates that all snapshots should be preserved.
+
'Snapshot retention (days)';; This configuration option allows you to
specify the number of days to retain snapshot components.  For example,
if you want to make sure that you are always keeping the last three
day's worth of snapshot components, configure this option with a value
of 3. The minimum count overrides this setting.
+
'Remove if released';; If enabled and a released component with the same
GAV coordinates is detected all snapshots will be removed.
+ 
'Grace period after release (days)';; The configuration 'Remove if
released' causes snapshots to be deleted as soon as the scheduled task
is executed. This can lead to builds that still reference the snapshot
dependency to fail. This grace period parameter allows you to specify
a number of days to delay the deletion, giving the respective projects
referencing the snapshot dependency time to upgrade to the release
component or the next snapshot version.
+
'Delete immediately';; If you want to have components deleted directly
rather than moved to the trash, you can enable this setting.
+
When doing regular deployments to a snapshot repository via a CI
server, this task should be configured to run regularly.
 
Remove Unused Snapshots From Repository:: This task allows you to 
have SNAPSHOT versions deleted from a Maven repository after they have 
not been requested for a specified number of days.

Repair Repositories Index:: In certain cases it might be required to remove the internal index as well as the
published ones of a repository.  This task does that and then rebuilds the internal index by first trying to
download remote indexes (if a proxy repository), then scanning the local storage and updating the internal index
accordingly. Lastly, the index is published for the repository as well. There should be no need to schedule this
task. But when upgrading the repository manager, the upgrade instructions may sometimes include a manual step of
executing this task.

Rubygems: Purge Broken Files on Proxy:: This task allows you to delete 
the broken metadata of a proxy gem repository. 

Rubygems: Rebuild Hosted Index Files:: This task can be used to 
get the metadata file for a hosted gem repository recreated based 
on the actual components found in the repository.

Rubygems: Synchronize Proxied Index File:: This task can be used to 
force an update of the metadata in a Gem proxy repository and cause it to 
be synchronized with the metadata in the remote repository.
 
Synchronize Shadow Repository:: This service synchronizes a shadow (or
virtual) repository with its master repository. This task is only
needed when external changes affected a source repository of a virtual
repository you are using.

Update Repositories Index:: If files are deployed directly to a repository's local storage (not deployed through
the user interface or client tools), you will need to instruct the repository manager to update its index. When
executing this task, the repository manager will update its index by first downloading remote indexes (if a proxy
repository) and then scan the local storage to index the new files.  Lastly, the index is published for the
repository as well. Normally, there should be no need to schedule this task. One possible exception would be if
files are deployed directly to the local storage regularly.
 
Yum: Generate Metadata:: The metadata for a yum repository is created
and maintained by the http://createrepo.baseurl.org/[createrepo]
tool. This scheduled task allows you to run it for a specific
repository and optionally configure the output directory. 

Beyond these tasks any plugin can provide additional scheduled tasks,
which will appear in the drop-down once you have installed the plugin.

The Evict and Purge actions do not delete data from the repository manager working directory. They simply move
data to be cleared or evicted to a trash directory under the work directory. If you want to reclaim disk
space, you need to clear the Trash on the Browse Repositories screen. If something goes wrong with a evict or
clear service, you can move the data back to the appropriate storage location from the trash.  You can also
schedule the Empty Trash service to clear this directory on a periodic basis.

TIP: In order to keep the heap usage in check it is recommended that
you schedule an "optimize indexes" task to run weekly. A number of
other maintenance tasks should also be scheduled for production
deployments.

Setting up scheduled tasks adapted to your usage of the repository manager is an important first step. Go through
the list of task types and consider your usage patterns of the repository manager. Also update your scheduled
tasks when changing your usage. E.g., if you start to regularly deploy snapshots by introducing continuous
integration server builds with deployment.

[[capabilities]]
=== Accessing and Configuring Capabilities

{inall}

Capabilities are features of the repository manager and plugins that can be configured by a user in the generic
administration view accessible in the left-hand navigation menu 'Administration' under 'Capabilities'.

WARNING: In many cases you will not need to configure anything in
'Capabilities' unless explicitly instructed to do so by the Sonatype
support team. Execute any capability changes with caution, potentially
backing up your configuration before proceeding.

{pro} ships with a number of capabilities preinstalled
and allows you to enable/disable them. An example capability is
'Outreach Management' displayed in <<fig-capability-outreach>>. The
capabilities management interface supports adding new capabilities by
pressing the 'New' button, copying a selected capability from the list
by pressing the 'Duplicate' button and deleting a selected capability with the
'Delete' button. Pressing the 'Refresh' button updates the list of
capabilities. The list of capabilities can be filtered with the search
input box in the header of the list and sorted by the different
columns by pressing a column header. The list uses the following
columns: 

Status:: The status column does not have a title. Enabled capabilities
have a green checkmark added on top of a blue icon. If an enabled
capability is not fully operational the icon displays a warning sign
on top of the blue icon and the entire row is surrounded with a red border;
you can find out further information in a warning message below the list of
the capabilities and above the individual tabs. Disabled capabilities use
a greyed out icon.

Type:: The 'Type' column provides the specific type of a capability in
the list.

Category:: The 'Category' is optional and details the wider context
the capability belongs to.

Repository:: The 'Repsitory' value is optional and references the
repository for which the specific capability is configured.

Description:: The 'Description' column contains further descriptive
information about the capability.

Notes:: The 'Notes' column can contain user created notes about the
capability.

[[fig-capability-outreach]]
.Capabilities Management Interface with the Outreach Management Details Visible
image::figs/web/capability-outreach.png[scale=60]

Every capability can be inspected and configured by selecting it in
the list and using the tabs underneath the list. 

The 'Summary' tab displays the 'Type' of the capability as well as
optionally the 'Description', the 'Category' and the 'Repository'. The
'Notes' field can be used to provide a descriptive text about the
capability or any other notes related to it and can be persisted by
pressing the 'Save' button. The 'Discard' link can be used 
to reset any changes in the tab.

The 'Settings' tab allows you to activate or deactivate the capability
with the 'Enabled' checkbox. Below this checkbox, each capability type
has specific additional configuration parameters available. Mousing over
the help icon beside the input field or checkbox reveals further
information about the specific parameter. Once you have completed the
configuration, press the 'Save' button. The 'Discard' link can be used 
to reset any changes in the tab.

The 'Status' tab displays a text message that details the status of the capability and any potential problems with
the configuration.  Depending on the capability, the reasons can vary widely. For example, the 'Secure Central'
capability requires the repository manager to run on a JVM with specific security features. If the JVM is not
suitable, an error message with further details is displayed in the 'Status' column.

The 'About' tab displays a descriptive text about the purpose of the
capability. 

Creating a new capability by pressing the 'New' button will display a
new form allowing you to configure the capability in a dialog. The
'Type' drop-down allows you to decide what capability to create, and a
selection changes the rest of the available information and
configuration in the dialog. You can configure if the capability
should be enabled with the 'Enabled' checkbox. Once you have completed
the configuration, press 'Add' and the capability will be saved and
appear in the list.

Many of the built-in capabilities and plugins can be configured in the 'Capabilities' administration section but
also in other more user friendly, targeted user interface sections, e.g., the user token feature administrated by
using the interface available via the 'User Token' menu item in the 'Security' left-hand menu as well as by
editing the user token capability. Other capabilities are internal to repository manager functionality and
sometimes managed automatically by the responsible plugin. Some optional configuration like the branding plugin is
only done in the capabilities administration. The branding plugin allows the customization of the icon in the top
left-hand corner of the user interface header and is described in <<nexus-branding>>.


[[nexus-branding]]
=== Customizing the User Interface with Branding

{inrmonly}

The branding plugin is part of {pro} and allows you to customize your repository manager instance by replacing the
default {pro} logo in the top left-hand corner of the header with an image of your choice.

You can configure it by adding the 'Branding' capabililty as documented in <<capabilities>> and enabling it. By
default, the branding plugin will look for the new logo in a file called +branding.png+ in your data directory's
+conf+ folder. By default, the location is therefore +sonatype-work/nexus/conf/branding.png+. The new logo needs
to be a PNG image. To blend in well in the UI, it is recommended that it is of 60 pixels height and has a
transparent background.

If it fails to find a new logo, the plugin will fall back to using the default logo.

Prior to {pro} 2.7, the branding plugin was an optional plugin of {pro} and needed to be installed following the
documentation in <<install-additional-plugins>>. In this case you needed to add a branding.image.path property to
the 'nexus.properties' file in '$NEXUS_HOME/conf/':

----
branding.image.path=/data/images/nexus_logo.png
----

[[nexus-outreach-plugin]]
=== Configuring Outreach Content in Welcome Tab

{inall}

The Outreach Plugin is installed and enabled by default in {oss} and {pro}. It allocates space underneath the
search feature on the 'Welcome' tab for linking to further documentation and support resources. This data is
retrieved from Sonatype servers.

In a case where this outgoing traffic from your repository manager instance or the resulting documentation and
links are not desired, the plugin can be disabled. The plugin can be disabled in the settings for the
'Outreach:Management' capability as documented in <<capabilities>>.

You can safely remove the plugin as well without any other negative side effects. To do so, simply remove the
'nexus-outreach-plugin-X.Y.Z' folder in '$NEXUS_HOME/nexus/WEB-INF/plugin-repository/' and restart your repository
manager instance.

[[confignx-sect-network]]
=== Network Configuration

{inall}

By default, the repository manager listens on port 8081. You can change this port, by changing the value in the
+$NEXUS_HOME/conf/nexus.properties+ file shown in <<fig-conf-nexus-properties>>. To change the port, stop the
repository manager, change the value of applicationPort in this file, and then restart it. Once you do this, you
should see a log statement in +$NEXUS_HOME/logs/wrapper.log+ telling you that the repository manager is listening
on the altered port.

[[logging]]
=== Logging

{inall}

You can configure the level of logging for the repository manager and all plugins as well as inspect the current
log using the user interface. Access the 'Logging' panel by clicking on the 'Logging' menu item in the
'Administration' submenu in the main menu. Clicking on this link will display the panel shown in
<<fig-configuring-log-config>>.

[[fig-configuring-log-config]]
.The Logging Panel with the Loggers Configuration
image::figs/web/repository-manager_log-config.png[scale=60]

The 'Loggers' tab in the panel allows you to configure the
preconfigured loggers as well as add and remove loggers. You can
modify the log level for a configured logger by clicking on the
'Level' value e.g., +INFO+. It will change into a drop-down of the
valid levels including +OFF+, +DEFAULT+, +INFO+ and others.  

If you select a row in the list of loggers, you can delete the highlighted logger by pressing the 'Remove' button
above the list. The 'Add' button beside it can be used to create new loggers in a dialog. You will need to know
the logger you want to configure. Depending on your needs you can inspect the source of {oss} and the plugins as
well as the source of your own plugins to determine the related loggers or contact Sonatype support for detailed
help. In addition, it is important to keep in mind that some loggers will change between repository manager and
plugin versions used.

The 'Reset' button allows you to remove all your custom loggers and get back to the setup shipped with the
repository manager.

The loggers configured in the user interface are persisted into +sonatype-work/nexus/conf/logback-overrides.xml+
and override any logging levels configured in the main log file +logback-nexus.xml+ as well as the other
+logback-*+ files. If you need to edit a logging level in those files, we suggest to edit the overrides file. This
will give you access to edit the configuration in the user interface at a later stage and also ensure that the
values you configure take precedence.

The 'ROOT' logger level controls how verbose the logging is in general. If set to +DEBUG+, logging will be very
verbose printing all log messages including debugging statements. If set to +ERROR+, logging will be far less
verbose, only printing out a log statement if the system encounters an error. +INFO+ represents an intermediate
amount of logging.

TIP: When configuring logging, keep in mind that heavy logging can
have a significant performance impact on an application and any
changes in the user interface trigger the change to the logging
immediately.

In {pro} releases prior to 2.7, logging configuration needed to be done by editing the +logback-nexus.xml+ file
found in +sonatype-work/nexus/conf+.

Once logging is configured as desired, you can inspect the impact of
your configuration on the 'Log' tab. It allows you to copy the log
from the server to your machine by pressing the 'Download' button. The
'Mark' button allows you to add a custom text string into the log, so
that you can create a reference point in the log file for an analysis of
the file. It will insert the text you entered surrounded by +*+
symbols as visible in <<fig-configuring-log-view>>.

[[fig-configuring-log-view]]
.Viewing the Log with a Mark
image::figs/web/repository-manager_log-view.png[scale=60]

The 'Refresh' button on the left triggers an immediate update of
the log. The refresh drop-down on the right can be used to trigger
updates of the log in regular time intervals or manually. The size
drop-down beside it allows you to control the size of the log snippet
displayed in the user interface.

[[confignx-sect-plugins]]
===  Plugins and the REST API

{inall}

As documented in <<install-additional-plugins>>, {pro} and {oss} are built as a collection of plugins supported by
a core architecture and additional plugins can be installed.

You can use the Plugin Console to list all installed plugins and browse REST services made available by the
installed plugins. To open the Plugin Console, click on the 'Plugin Console' link in the 'Administration' menu in
the left-hand main menu.

Once you open the Plugin Console, you will see a list of plugins
installed in your repository manager installation. Clicking on a plugin in this
list will display information about the plugin including name,
version, status, a description, SCM information about the plugin, and
the URL of the plugin's project web site and links to the plugin
documentation.

[[fig-config-plugin-console]]
.Plugin Console
image::figs/web/config-plugin-console.png[scale=50]

All the functionality in the user interface is accessing the REST API's provided by the different plugins.  An
example for the plugin documentation is the main documentation for the core Nexus API linked off the Nexus Restlet
1.x Plugin from <<fig-config-plugin-console>> and displayed in <<fig-config-plugin-core-api-site>>

[[fig-config-plugin-core-api-site]]
.Documentation Website for the Core REST API
image::figs/web/config-plugin-core-api-site.png[scale=50]

You can use the REST API to integrate the repository manager with your external systems.

If your external integration uses Java, or is otherwise JVM based, then you can use the {pro} client using the
dependency from <<fig-client-core-dependency>> with the version corresponding to your repository manager version.

=== Managing Security

{inall}

{pro} and {oss} use a role-based access control (RBAC) system that gives administrators very fine-grained control
over who can read from a repository (or a subset of repositories), who can administer the server, and who can
deploy to repositories. The security model in the repository manager is also so flexible as to allow you to
specify that only certain users or roles can deploy and manage components in a specific repository under a
specific groupId or asset class. The default configuration of {pro} and {oss} ships with four roles and four users
with a standard set of permissions that will make sense for most users. As your security requirements evolve,
you'll likely need to customize security settings to create protected repositories for multiple departments or
development groups. {pro} and {oss} provide a security model which can adapt to any scenario. The security
configuration is done via menu items in the 'Security' submenu in the left-hand main menu.

The RBAC system is designed around the following four security concepts:

Privileges:: Privileges are rights to read, update, create, or manage resources and perform operations. The
repository manager ships with a set of core privileges that cannot be modified, and you can create new privileges
to allow for fine-grained targeting of role and user permissions for specific repositories.

Targets:: Privileges are usually associated with resources or targets. A target can be a specific repository or a
set of repositories grouped in something called a repository target. A target can also be a subset of a repository
or a specific set of assests within a repository e.g. all javadoc archives only.  Using a target you can for
example also apply a specific privilege to a single groupId and all components using it.

Roles:: Collections of privileges can be grouped into roles to make it
easier to define collections of privileges common to certain classes
of users. For example, deployment users will all have similar sets of
permissions. Instead of assigning individual privileges to individual
users, you use roles to make it easier to manage users with similar
sets of privileges. A role has one or more privileges and/or one or
more roles.

Users:: Users can be assigned roles and will model the individuals who will be logging into the repository manager
and reading, deploying, or managing repositories.

[[security-privileges]]
=== Managing Privileges

{inall}

You can access the configuration of privileges via the 'Privileges'
menu item in the 'Security' submenu in the left-hand main menu.

The repository manager has three types of privileges:

* application privileges - covers actions a user can execute in the user interface,
* repository target privileges - governs the level of access a user has to a particular repository or repository
target, and
* repository view privileges - controls whether a user can view a repository

Behind the scenes, a privilege is related to a single REST operation 
and method like create, update, delete, read.

.Managing Security Privileges
image::figs/web/repository-manager_security-privileges.png[scale=60]

To create a new privilege, click on the 'Add...' button in the
'Privileges' panel and choose 'Repository Target Privilege'. Creating a
privilege will load the New Repository Target Privilege form shown in
<<fig-configuring-new-privilege>>. This form takes a privilege name, a
privilege description, the repository to target, and a repository
target.

[[fig-configuring-new-privilege]]
.Creating a New Repository Target Privilege
image::figs/web/repository-manager_security-privileges-2.png[scale=60]

Once you create a new privilege, it will create four underlying
privileges: create, delete, read, and update. The four privileges
created by the form in <<fig-configuring-new-privilege>>
are shown in <<fig-configuring-new-privileges>>.

[[repository-targets]]
=== Managing Repository Targets

{inall}

A 'Repository Target' is a set of regular expressions to match on the path of components in a repository (in the
same way as the routing rules work). {pro} and {oss} are preconfigured with a number of repository targets and
allows you to create additional ones. Access the management interface visible in <<fig-config-repo-target-mgt>>
via the 'Repository Targets' menu item in the left-hand 'Views/Repositories' sub menu.


[[fig-config-repo-target-mgt]]
.Managing Repository Targets
image::figs/web/repository-manager_repository-targets.png[scale=60]

Repository targets allow you to define, for example, a target called
Apache Maven with a pattern of `^/org/apache/maven/.*`. This would
match all components with a groupId of 'org.apache.maven' and any
components within nested groupIds like 'org.apache.maven.plugins'.

A pattern that would capture more components like all components with
any part of the path containing 'maven' could be `.*maven.*`.

The regular expressions can also be used to exclude components as
visible with the pattern `(?!.*-sources.*).*` in
<<fig-config-repo-target-exclude>> where components with the qualifier
'-sources' are excluded. The syntax used for the expressions is the
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/[Java syntax],
that is similar but not identical to the Perl syntax.

[[fig-config-repo-target-exclude]]
.Excluding Source Components from a Repository Targets
image::figs/web/repository-manager_repository-targets-2.png[scale=60]

By combining multiple patterns in a repository target, you can
establish a fine-grained control of components included and excluded.

Once you have created a repository target, you can utilize it as part
of your security setup.  You can add a new privilege that relates to
the target and controls the CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete)
operations for artifacts matching that path. The privilege can even
span multiple repositories. With this setup you can delegate all
control of components in 'org.apache.maven' to a "Maven" team. In this
way, you don't need to create separate repositories for each logical
division of your components.

Repository targets are also be used for matching components for
implicit capture in the Staging Suite as documented in <<staging>>.

[[security-roles]]
=== Managing Roles

{inall}

{pro} and {oss} ship with a large number of roles predefined including 'Nexus Administrator Role', 'Nexus
Anonymous Role', 'Nexus Developer Role', and 'Nexus Deployment Role'.  Click on the 'Roles' menu item under
'Security' in the main menu to show the list of roles shown in <<fig-configuring-security-roles>>.

[[fig-configuring-security-roles]]
.Viewing the List of Defined Roles
image::figs/web/repository-manager_security-roles.png[scale=60]

To create a new role, click on the 'Add...' button, select 'Nexus Role' and fill out the 'New Nexus Role' form
shown in <<fig-configuring-creating-new-role>>.

[[fig-configuring-creating-new-role]]
.Creating a New Nexus Role
image::figs/web/repository-manager_security-new-nexus-role.png[scale=60]

When creating a new role, you will need to supply a 'Role ID', a
'Name' and a 'Description'. Roles are comprised of other roles and
individual privileges. To assign a role or privilege to a role, click
on 'Add' button under 'Role/Privilege Management' to access the 'Add
Roles and Privileges' dialog displayed in
<<fig-configuring-add-role-dialog>>. It allows you to filter the paged
displayed of all the available roles and privileges with a filter text
as well as narrowing the search to roles or privileges only. Using the
filter and the paging you will be able to find the desired role or
privilege quickly.

[[fig-configuring-add-role-dialog]]
.The Dialog to Add Roles and Privileges
image::figs/web/repository-manager_security-add-roles-dialog.png[scale=60]

The built-in roles are managed by Nexus and cannot be edited or
deleted. The role confirguration section below the list is visible but 
disabled for these roles.

A role is comprised of other roles and individual privileges. To view the component parts of a role, select the
 role in the Roles list and then choose the 'Role Tree' tab as shown in <<fig-configuring-role-tree>>.

[[fig-configuring-role-tree]]
.Viewing a Role Tree
image::figs/web/repository-manager_security-role-tree.png[scale=60]

TIP: With the Repository Targets, you have fine-grained control over
every action in the system. For example, you could make a target that
includes everything except sources `(.*(?!-sources)\.*)` and assign that
to one role while giving yet another role access to everything. Using
these different access roles e.g., you can host your public and private
components in a single repository without giving up control of your
private components.

[[confignx-sect-managing-users]]
=== Managing Users

{inall}

{pro} and {oss} ships with three users: 'admin', 'anonymous', and 'deployment'. The admin user has all privileges,
the anonymous user has read-only privileges, and the deployment user can both read and deploy to repositories. If
you need to create users with a more focused set of permissions, you can click on 'Users' under 'Security' in the
left-hand main menu. Once you see the list of users, you can click on a user to edit that specific user's 'First
Name', 'Last Name' and 'Email'. Editing a users 'Status' allows you to activate or disable a user altogether. You
can also assign or revoke specific roles for a particular user.

.Managing Users
image::figs/web/repository-manager_security-users.png[scale=50]

Clicking the 'Add' button in the 'Role Management' section will bring up
the list of available roles in a pop-up window visible in
<<fig-config-security-user-add-role>>. It allows you filter and search
for roles and add one or multiple roles to the user.

[[fig-config-security-user-add-role]]
.Adding Roles to a User
image::figs/web/config-security-user-add-role.png[scale=60]

A user can be assigned one or more roles that in turn can include references to other roles or to individual
privileges. To view a tree of assigned roles and privileges, select the 'Role Tree' for a particular user as shown
in <<fig-configuring-security-user-role-tree>>.

[[fig-configuring-security-user-role-tree]]
.User Role Tree
image::figs/web/repository-manager_security-users-role-tree.png[scale=70]

If you need to find out exactly how a particular user has been granted
a particular privilege, you can use the 'Privilege Trace' panel as shown
in <<fig-configuring-security-user-priv-trace>>.  The 'Privilege
Trace' panel lists all of the privileges that have been granted to a
particular user in the 'Privileges' section. Clicking on a privilege
loads a tree of roles that grant that particular privilege to a
user. If a user has been assigned a specific privilege by more than
one Role or Privilege assignment, you will be able to see this
reflected in the 'Role Containment' list.

[[fig-configuring-security-user-priv-trace]]
.User Privilege Trace
image::figs/web/repository-manager_security-users-privilege.png[scale=60]

Additional plugins can contribute further panels for the security
configuration of a user. An example of an additional panel is the 'User
Token' panel, added by the User Token feature of {pro} as
documented in <<usertoken>>.

[[usertoken]]
=== Security Setup with User Tokens

{inrmonly}

==== Introduction

When using Apache Maven with {pro} or {oss}, the user credentials for accessing the repository manager have to be
stored in clear text in the user's settings.xml file. Maven has the ability to encrypt passwords in setting.xml,
but the need for it to be reversible in order to be used, limits its security. In addition, the general setup and
use is cumbersome, and the potential need for regular changes due to strong security requirements e.g., with
regular, required password changes triggers the need for a simpler and more secure solution.

Other build systems use similar approaches and can benefit from the
usage of User Token as well.

The User Token feature of {pro} fills that need for Apache Maven as well as other build systems and users. It
introduces a two-part token for the user, replacing the username and password with a user code and a pass code
that allows no way of recovering the username and password from the user code and pass code values; yet can be
used for authentication with the repository manager from the command line via Maven as well as in the UI.

This is especially useful for scenarios where single sign-on solutions like LDAP are used for authentication
against the repository manager and other systems and the plain text username and password cannot be stored in the
+settings.xml+ following security policies. In this scenario the generated user tokens can be used instead.

User token usage is integrated in the Maven settings template feature of {pro} documented in <<maven-settings>> to
further simplify its use.

==== Enabling and Resetting User Tokens

The user token-based authentication can be activated by an administrator or user with the role usertoken-admin or
usertoken-all by accessing the 'User Token' item in the 'Security' submenu on the left-hand main menu.

Once user token is 'Enabled' by activating the checkbox in the
administration tab displayed in <<fig-config-user-token-main>> and
pressing 'Save',  the feature is activated and the additional section to
Reset All User Tokens is available as well.

[[fig-config-user-token-main]]
.User Token Administration Tab Panel
image::figs/web/config-user-token-main.png[scale=60]

Selecting the 'Protect Content' feature configures the repository manager to require a user token for any access
to the content URLs that includes all repositories and groups. This affects read access as well as write access
e.g., for deployments from a build execution or a manual upload.

'Activating User Token' as a feature automatically adds the 'User
Token Realm' as a 'Selected Realm' in the 'Security Settings' section as
displayed in <<fig-config-user-token-security-settings>> and available
in the 'Server' section of the left-hand 'Administration' menu. If
desired, you can reorder the security realms used, although the
default settings with the 'User Token Realm' as a first realm is
probably the desired setup. This realm is not removed when the User
Token feature is disabled; however, it will cleanly pass through to the
next realm and with the realm remaining any order changes stay
persisted in case the feature is reactivated at a later stage.


[[fig-config-user-token-security-settings]]
.Selected Realms Server Security Settings with User Token Realm activated
image::figs/web/config-user-token-security-settings.png[scale=60]

Besides resetting all user tokens, an administrator can reset the token
of an individual user by selecting the 'User Token' tab in the 'Users'
administration from the 'Security' menu in the left-hand navigation
displayed in <<fig-config-user-token-user-reset>>. The password
requested for this action to proceed is the password for the currently
logged in administrator resetting the token(s).

[[fig-config-user-token-user-reset]]
.User Token Reset for Specific User in Security Users Administration
image::figs/web/config-user-token-user-reset.png[scale=50]

WARNING: Resetting user tokens forces the users to update the
`settings.xml` with the newly created tokens and potentially breaks any
command line builds using the tokens until this change is
carried out. This specifically also applies to continuous integration
servers using user tokens or any other automated build executions.

==== Accessing and Using Your User Tokens

With user token enabled, any user can access his/her individual tokens via their 'Profile' panel. To access the
panel, select 'Profile' when clicking on the user name in the top right-hand corner of the user interface. Then
select 'User Token' in the drop-down to get access to the 'User Token' screen in the 'Profile panel' displayed in
<<fig-config-user-token-profile>>.

[[fig-config-user-token-profile]]
.User Token Panel for the Logged in Users in the Profile Section
image::figs/web/config-user-token-profile.png[scale=50]

In order to be able to see this 'User Token' panel the user has to have
the +usertoken-basic+ role or the +usertoken-user+ privilege. To access or
reset the token you have to press the respective button in the panel
and then provide your username and password in the dialog.

Resetting the token will show and automatically hide a dialog with a
success message and accessing the token will show the dialog displayed
in <<fig-config-user-token-access>>.

[[fig-config-user-token-access]]
.Accessing the User Token Information
image::figs/web/config-user-token-access.png[scale=40]

The User Token dialog displays the user code and pass code tokens in separate fields in the top level section as
well as a server section ready to be used in a Maven settings.xml file. When using the server section you simply
have to replace the `${server}` placeholder with the repository id that references your repository manager you
want to authenticate against with the user token.  The dialog will close automatically after one minute or can be
closed with the Close button.

The user code and pass code values can be used as replacements for username and password in the login dialog. It
is also possible to use the original username and the pass code to log in to the user interface.

With content protection enabled, command line access to the repository manager will require the tokens to be
supplied. Access to e.g., the releases repository via

----
curl -v --user admin:admin http://localhost:9081/content/repositories/releases/
----

has to be replaced with the usage of user code and pass code separated
by colon in the curl command line like this

----
curl -v --user HdeHuL4x:Y7ZH6ixZFdOVwNpRhaOV+phBISmipsfwVxPRUH1gkV09 http://localhost:9081/content/repositories/releases/
----

User token values can be accessed as part of the Maven settings template feature automating updates as documented
in <<maven-settings>>.

NOTE: The user tokens are created at first access whether that is by using the user interface or the Nexus Maven
Plugin.

==== Configuring User Token behavior

The user token feature is preconfigured with built-in parameters and
no external configuration file is created by default. It is however
possible to customize some behavior by creating a file
'sonatype-work/nexus/conf/usertoken.properties''.

The following properties can be configured:

////
According to Jason Dillon this is mostly for testing the underlying
mechanis and the super edge case when the default strategy incurs too
many name-code collissions, this is also not well tested so we remove
it for now (or ever)
usertoken.encodingStrategyProvider.strategy:: 	Define the
EncodingStrategy for the token with the default value being
'6-33-Base64' and '9-30-Base64' as optional alternative strategy.
similar to above, very advanced and should not be exposed to users at
this stage according to Jason Dillon
usertoken.userTokenServiceImpl.maximumUniqueNameCodeAttempts::
The maximum number of retries to find a unique name code, when
creating the token. Defaults to 10.
////

usertoken.userTokenServiceImpl.allowLookupByUserName:: This parameter controls
if username lookup is allowed when using a pass code. The default is
set to true. If set to false, user code and pass code have to be used
to authenticate, otherwise username and pass code is also
possible. This would be the more secure setting.
usertoken.userTokenServiceImpl.restrictByUserAgent:: With this value
set to true (the default), any access to the repository manager content
with content protection enabled will only be allowed to browser-based 
access even without credentials. Other tools like curl or wget
or other command-line tools will be blocked. With the more secure
setting of +false+, any access without correct codes will be
disallowed.

The 'usertoken.' prefix is optional when the properties are loaded
from the 'usertoken.properties' file.


[[rutauth]]
=== Authentication via Remote User Token

{inall}

{pro} and {oss} allows integration with external security systems that can pass along authentication of a user via
the +Remote_User+ HTTP header field - Remote User Token 'Rut' authentication. There are either web-based container
or server-level authentication systems like http://shibboleth.net/[Shibboleth]. In many cases, this is achieved
via a server like http://httpd.apache.org/[Apache HTTPD] or http://nginx.org/[nginx] proxying the repository
manager. These servers can in turn defer to other authentication storage systems e.g., via the
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/[Kerberos] network authentication protocol. These systems and setups can be described
as Central Authentication Systems CAS or Single Sign On SSO.

From the users perspective, he/she is required to login into the environment in a central login page that then
propagates the login status via HTTP headers. The repository manager simply receives the fact that a specific user
is logged in by receiving the username in a HTTP header field.

The HTTP header integration can be activated by adding and enabling the 'Rut Auth' capability as documented in
<<capabilities>> and setting the 'HTTP Header name' to the header populated by your security system. Typically,
this value is +REMOTE_USER+, but any arbitrary value can be set. An enabled capability automatically causes the
'Rut Auth Realm' to be added to the 'Selected Realms' in the 'Security Settings' described in
<<security-settings>>.

When an external system passes a value through the header, authentication will be granted and the value will be
used as the user name for configured authorization scheme. For example, on a default repository manager
installation with the Xml authorization scheme enabled, a value of 'deployment' would grant the user the access
rights in the user interface as the 'deployment' user.

A seamless integration can be set up for users if the external security system is exposed via LDAP and configured
in the repository manager as LDAP authorization realm combined with external role mappings and in parallel the
sign-on is integrated with the operating system sign-on for the user.
