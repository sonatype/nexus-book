[[security-introduction]]
=== Introduction

{pro} and {oss} use role-based access control that gives administrators very fine-grained control over user
rights to

* read from a repository or a subset of repositories
* administer the repository manager or specific parts of the configuration
* access specific parts of the user interface
* deploy to repositories or even just specific sections of a repository

The default configuration ships with roles and users with a standard set of permissions. As your security
requirements evolve, you will likely need to customize security settings to create protected repositories for
multiple departments or development groups. {nxrm} provides a security model that can adapt to any
scenario.

TIP: The default administrator user give you full control and uses the username 'admin' and the password
'admin123'.

This chapter covers all aspects of security of the repository manager including

* user account and access right management related to user interface as well as to component access documented in
  <<privileges>>, <<roles>> and <<users>>
* selection of security backend systems documented <<realms>> including the built-in system as well as
  <<ldap,LDAP>> and others
* management of SSL certificates from remote repositories, SMTP and LDAP servers documented in <<ssl>>


Security-related configuration can be performed with the feature views available via the 'Security' section of the
'Administration' main menu. Many of the features shown in this section are only available to users with the
necessary privileges to access them.

The role-based access control system is backed by different authentication and authorizations systems as
documented in <<realms>> and designed around the following security concepts:

Privileges:: <<privileges, Privileges>> are rights to read, update, create, or manage resources and perform
operations related to the user interface as well as the components managed by the repository manager in the
various repositories. The repository manager ships with a set of core privileges that cannot be modified.

Roles:: Privileges can be grouped into collections called <<roles, roles>> to make it easier to define privileges
common to certain classes of users. For example, administrative users will all have similar sets of permissions.
Instead of assigning individual privileges to individual users, you use roles to make it easier to manage users
with similar sets of privileges.

Users:: <<users, Users>> can be assigned one or more roles, and model the individuals who will be logging into the
user interface and read, deploy, or manage repositories as well as connect from client tools such as Apache Maven.

[[realms]]
=== Realms
{inall}

The feature view for security realms administration displayed in <<fig-realms>> allows you to activate and 
prioritize security realms used for authentication and authorization by adding them to the 'Active' list on the 
right and placing them higher or lower on the list. It can be accessed via the 'Realms' menu item in the 
'Security' submenu in the 'Administration' main menu.

[[fig-realms]]
.Security Realms Administration
image::figs/web/realms.png[scale=60]

Effectively, this configuration determines what authentication realm is used to grant a user access and the order
the realms are used.

Nexus Authenticating Realm and Nexus Authorizing Realm:: These are the built-in realms used by default. They allow
the repository manager to manage security setup without additional external systems.

Crowd Realm:: This realm identifies external storage in an Atlassian Crowd system with details documented in 
<<crowd>>.

LDAP Realm:: This realm identifies external storage in an LDAP system including e.g., Microsoft ActiveDirectory,
ApacheDS, OpenLDAP with details documented in <<ldap>>.

npm Bearer Token Realm:: This realm permits users with previously generated bearer tokens to publish 'npm'
packages. See <<npm-security,npm Security>> to learn how to establish a connection in order to publish.

NuGet API-Key Realm:: This realm is required for deployments to NuGet repositories as documented in <<nuget>>.

Rut Auth Realm:: This realm uses an external authentication in any system with the user authorization passed to
the repository manager in a HTTP header field with details documented in <<remote-user-token>>.

User Token Realm:: This realm activates token-based authentication for users as a substitute for plain-text
username and password authentication. When the user token capability is enabled, the realm is automatically
added to the 'Active Realms' list. A full description of this realm is documented in <<user-token-realms>>.

WARNING: Removing all realms from the 'Active' section prevents access to the repository manager for any user
including any administrative access and has to be avoided.


[[privileges]]
=== Privileges
{inall}

Privileges control access to specific functionality of the repository manager and can be grouped as a role and
assigned to a specific users.

To access 'Privileges' go to 'Security' in the 'Administration' menu, where it's listed as a sub-section.
An extensive list of privileges is already built in the repository manager and is partially depicted in
<<fig-privileges-partial-list>>. This feature allows you inspect existing privileges and create custom
privileges.

[[fig-privileges-partial-list]]
.Partial List of Security Privileges
image::figs/web/privileges-partial-list.png[scale=70]

The list of privileges displays an icon for the privilege Type as the first column, followed by:

Name:: the internal identifier for the privilege

Description:: a human readable description of the purpose of the privilege

Type:: the aspect of the repository manager to which this privilege applies

Permission:: the internal permission definition as used by the embedded security framework

Further details are available after pressing on a specific row in the detail view.

Click the 'Create privilege' button to view a list of privilege types, as seen in <<fig-privileges-types>>.

[[fig-privileges-types]]
.Choosing Privilege Types
image::figs/web/privileges-types.png[scale=80]

Select the type corresponding to the area of the repository manager you wish to grant permissions. When you
create a new 'Privilege Type' you must assign at least one action in the 'Actions' field.

The 'Privilege Types' are as follows:

Application:: These are privileges related to a specific domain in the repository manager.
Repository Admin:: These are privileges related to the administration and configuration of a specific repository.
Repository Content Selector:: These are privileges attributed to filtered content within a format, evaluated
against a JEXL expression.
Repository View:: These are privileges controlling access to the content of a specific repository.
Script:: These are privileges related to the execution and management of scripts as documented in <<scripting>>.
Wildcard:: These are privileges that use patterns to group other privileges.

[[privileges-actions]]
==== Actions

'Actions' are functions allowing an explicit behavior the privilege can perform with the associated function.

The 'Actions' to choose from are  `add`, `browse`, `create`, `delete`, `edit`, `read`, `update`, and `*`. You
can assign a single or combination of comma-delimited actions when creating new privileges. The privilege
type to which you apply any of these 'Actions' will perform the action's implied behavior. Consider how each
action behaves when applied to a privilege type:

`add`:: This action allows privileges to add repositories or scripts.

`browse`:: This action allows privileges to view the contents of associated repositories. Unlike `read`,
privilege types with `browse` can only view and administrate repository contents from UI.

`create`:: This action allows privileges to create applicable configurations within the repository manager.
Since a `read` permission is required to view a configuration, this action is associated with most existing
`create` privileges.

`delete`:: This action allows privileges to delete repository manager configurations, repository contents, and
scripts. A `read` action is generally associated with `delete` actions so the actor can view these configurations
to remove them.

`edit`:: This action allows privileges to modify associated scripts, repository content, and repository
administration.

`read`:: This action allows privileges to view various configuration lists and scripts. Without `read`, any
associated action will permit a privilege to see these lists but not its contents. The `read` action also allows
privileges to utilize tools that can look at content from the command line.

`update`:: This action allows privileges to update repository manager configurations. Most existing privileges
with `update` include `read` actions. Therefore, if creating custom privileges with `update`, the actor should
consider adding `read` to the privilege in order to view repository manager configuration updates.

`*`:: This action is a wildcard giving you the ability to group all actions together.

To save a new custom privilege click the 'Create privilege' button. The privilege can be found listed among the
default privileges on the main 'Privileges' screen. You can use the 'Filter' input box to find a specific
privilege.

In the following example, an 'Application' privilege type is created.

[[fig-privileges-application]]
.Creating an Application Privilege
image::figs/web/privileges-application.png[scale=80]

The form provides 'Name', 'Description', 'Domain', and 'Actions'. In <<fig-privileges-application>> the form is
completed for a privilege only thats allows read access to the LDAP administration. If assigned this privilege, a
user is able to view LDAP administration configuration but not edit it, create a new LDAP configuration, nor
delete any existing LDAP configurations.

In another example, a 'Repository View' privilege type is created.

[[fig-privileges-repository-view]]
.Creating a Repository View Privilege
image::figs/web/privileges-repository-view.png[scale=80]

The form provides 'Name', 'Description', 'Format', 'Repository', and 'Actions'. In
<<fig-privileges-repository-view>> the form is completed for a privilege granting sufficient access to publish
images to a specific hosted repository. A user with this privilege can view and read the contents of the
repository as well as publish new images to it, but not delete images.

You can also assign privileges to users, and any assigned role, so they can have read-only access to a specific
group repository. By default, these permissions will only allow users to read contents via the assigned group.
Additionally, users cannot access the contents of a group repository via members inside the group unless the
member repository is assigned the same privileges as the group.

[[roles]]
=== Roles
{inall}

Roles aggregate privileges into a related context and can, in turn, be grouped to create more complex roles.

The repository manager ships with a predefined 'admin' as well as an 'anonymous' role. These can be inspected in
the 'Roles' feature view accessible via the 'Roles' item in the 'Security' section of the 'Administration' main
menu. A simple example is shown in <<fig-roles-list>>. The list displays the 'Name' and 'Description' of the role
as well as the 'Source', which displays whether the role is internal ('Nexus') or a mapping to an external source
like LDAP.

[[fig-roles-list]]
.Viewing the List of Defined Roles
image::figs/web/roles-list.png[scale=60]

To create a new role, click on the 'Create role' button, select 'Nexus Role' and fill out the Role creation 
feature view shown in <<fig-roles-create>>.

[[fig-roles-create]]
.Creating a New Role
image::figs/web/roles-create.png[scale=60]

When creating a new role, you will need to supply a 'Role ID' and a 'Name' and optionally a 'Description'. Roles
are comprised of other roles and individual privileges. To assign a role or privilege to a role, drag and drop the
desired privileges from the 'Available' list to the 'Given' list under the 'Privileges' header. You can use the
'Filter' input to narrow down the list of displayed privileges and the arrow buttons to add or remove privileges.

The same functionality is available under the 'Roles' header to select among the 'Available' roles and add them to
the list of 'Contained' roles.

Finally press the 'Create Role' button to get the role created.

An existing role can be inspected and edited by clicking on the row in the list. This role-specific view allows
you to delete the role with the 'Delete role' button. The built-in roles are managed by the repository manager and
cannot be edited or deleted. The 'Settings' section displays the same section as the creation view as displayed in
<<fig-roles-create>>.

In addition to creating an internal role, the 'Create role' button allows you to create an 'External role mapping'
to an external authorization system configured in the repository manager such as 'LDAP'. This is something you
would do, if you want to grant every member of an externally managed group (such as an LDAP group) a number of
privileges and roles in the repository manager.

For example, assume that you have a group in LDAP named +scm+ and you want to make sure that everyone in the +scm+
group has administrative privileges.

Select 'External Role Mapping' and 'LDAP' to see a list of roles managed by that external realm in a dialog. Pick 
the desired 'scm' group and confirm by pressing 'Create mapping'.

TIP: For faster access or if you cannot see your group name, you can also type in a portion or the whole name of 
the group and it will limit the dropdown to the selected text.

Once the external role has been selected, creates a linked  role. You can then assign other roles and privileges 
to this new externally mapped role like you would do for any other role.

Any user that is part of the 'scm' group in LDAP, receives all the privileges defined in the created role allowing
you to adapt your generic role in LDAP to the repository manager-specific use cases you want these users to be
allowed to perform.

[[users]]
=== Users
{inall}

The repository manager ships with two users: 'admin' and 'anonymous'. The 'admin' user has all privileges and the
'anonymous' user has read-only privileges. The default password for the 'admin' user is 'admin123'.

The 'Users' feature view displayed in <<fig-users-list>> can be accessed via the 'Users' item in the 'Security' 
section of the 'Administration' menu. The list shows the users 'User ID', 'First Name', 'Last Name' and 'Email' 
as well as what security 'Realm' is used and if the accounts 'Status' is 'active' or 'disabled'.

[[fig-users-list]]
.Feature View with List of Users
image::figs/web/users-list.png[scale=50]

Clicking on a user in the list or clicking on the 'Create user' button displays the details view to edit or 
create the account shown in <<fig-users-create>>. The 'ID' can be defined upon initial creation and remains fixed 
thereafter. In addition you can specify the users 'First Name', 'Last Name' and 'Email' address. The 'Status' 
allows you to set an account to be 'Disabled' or 'Active'.

The 'Roles' control allows you to add and remove defined <<roles, roles>> to the user and therefore control the
<<privileges,privileges>> assigned to the user. A user can be assigned one or more roles that in turn can include
references to other roles or to individual privileges.

[[fig-users-create]]
.Creating or Editing a User
image::figs/web/users-create.png[scale=60]

The 'More' button in the allows you to select the 'Change Password' item in the drop down. The password can be 
changed in a dialog, provided the user is managed by the built-in security realm.

IMPORTANT: Ensure to change the password of the 'admin' user to avoid security issues. Alternatively create
other users with administrative rights and disable the default 'admin' user.

[[anonymous]]
=== Anonymous Access
{inall}

By default, the user interface as well as the repositories and the contained components are available to
unauthenticated users for read access. The 'Anonymous' feature view is available via the 'Anonymous' item in the
'Security' section of the 'Administration' main menu and shown in <<fig-anonymous>>.

The privileges available to these users are controlled by the roles assigned to the 'anonymous' user from the
'NexusAuthorizingRole'. By changing the privileges assigned to this user in the <<users, Users feature view>>.

[[fig-anonymous]]
.Configuring Anonymous Access
image::figs/web/anonymous.png[scale=60]

If you want to disable unauthenticated access to the repository manager entirely, you can uncheck the 'Allow
anonymous users to access the server' checkbox. The 'Username' and 'Realm' controls allow you to change the
details for the anonymous user. E.g. you might have a 'guest' account defined in your LDAP system and desire to
use that user for anonymous access.


[[ldap]]
=== LDAP
{inall}


[[ldap-introduction]]
==== Introduction 

{pro} and {oss} can use the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for authentication via external systems
providing LDAP support such as Microsoft Exchange/Active Directory, http://www.openldap.org/[OpenLDAP],
https://directory.apache.org/apacheds/[ApacheDS] and others.

Configuring LDAP can be achieved in a few simple steps:

* Enable LDAP Authentication Realm
* Create LDAP server configuration with connections and user/group mapping details
* Create external role mappings to adapt LDAP roles to repository manager specific usage

In addition to handling authentication, the repository manager can be configured to map roles to LDAP user
groups. If a user is a member of a LDAP group that matches the ID of a role, the repository manager grants that
user the matching role. In addition to this highly configurable user and group mapping capability, the repository
manager can augment LDAP group membership with specific user-role mapping.

The repository manager can cache authentication information and supports multiple LDAP servers and user/group
mappings. Connection details to the LDAP server and the user/group mappings as well as specific account logins can
be tested directly from the user interface.

All these feature allow you to adapt to any specific LDAP usage scenario and take advantage of the central
authentication set up across your organization in all your repository managers.

[[ldap-sect-enabling]]
==== Enabling the LDAP Authentication Realm

As seen in <<fig-realms>>, activate your 'LDAP Realm' by following these steps:

- Navigate to the <<realms, Realms>> administration section
- Select the 'LDAP Realm' and add it to the list of 'Active' realms on the right
- Ensure that the 'LDAP Realm' is located beneath the 'Nexus Authenticating Realm' in the list
- Press 'Save'

Best practice is to leave the 'Nexus Authenticating Realm' and the 'Nexus Authorizing Realm' activated so that the
repository manager can be used by 'anonymous', 'admin' and other users configured in this realm even with LDAP
authentication offline or unavailable. Any user account not found in the 'Nexus Authenticating Realm', will be
passed through to LDAP authentication.

[[ldap-sect-connecting]]
==== LDAP Connection and Authentication

The 'LDAP' feature view displayed in <<fig-ldap-feature>> is available via the 'LDAP' item in the 'Security'
section of the 'Administration' main menu.

[[fig-ldap-feature]]
.LDAP Feature View
image::figs/web/ldap-feature.png[scale=80]

The 'Order' determines in which order the repository manager connects to the LDAP servers when authenticating a
user. The 'Name' and 'URL' columns identify the configuration and clicking on a individual row provides access to
the 'Connection' and 'User and group' configuration.

The 'Create connection' button can be used to create a new LDAP server configuration. Multiple configurations can
be created and are accessible in the list.

The 'Change order' button can be used to change the order in which the repository manager queries the LDAP servers
in a pop up dialog.

Successful authentications are cached so that subsequent logins do not require a new query to the LDAP
server each time. The 'Clear cache' button can be used to remove these cached authentications. 

TIP: Contact the administrator of your LDAP server to figure out the correct parameters, as they vary between
different LDAP server vendors, versions and individual configurations performed by the administrators.

The following parameters allow you to create an LDAP connection:

Name:: Enter a unique name for the new configuration.

LDAP server address:: Enter 'Protocol', 'Hostname', and 'Port' of your LDAP server.

Protocol;; Valid values in this drop-down are +ldap+ and +ldaps+ that correspond to the Lightweight Directory 
Access Protocol and the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol over SSL.

Hostname;; The hostname or IP address of the LDAP server.

Port;; The port on which the LDAP server is listening. Port 389 is the default port for the +ldap+ protocol, and 
port 636 is the default port for the +ldaps+.

Search base:: The search base furhter qualifies the connection to the LDAP server. The search base usually
corresponds to the domain name of an organization. For example, the search base could be +dc=example,dc=com+.

You can configure one of four authentication methods to be used when connecting to the LDAP Server with the
'Authentication method' drop-down.

Simple Authentication:: Simple authentication consists of a 'Username' and 'Password'. Simple authentication is
not recommended for production deployments not using the secure `ldaps` protocol as it sends a clear-text password
over the network.

Anonymous Authentication:: The anonymous authentication uses the server address and search base without further
authentication.

Digest-MD5:: This is an improvement on the CRAM-MD5 authentication
method. For more information, see http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2831.txt/[RFC-2831].

CRAM-MD5:: The Challenge-Response Authentication Method (CRAM) is based on the HMAC-MD5 MAC algorithm. In this 
authentication method, the server sends a challenge string to the client. The client responds with a username 
followed by a Hex digest that the server compares to an expected value. For more information, see 
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2195.html/[RFC-2195].

For a full discussion of LDAP authentication approaches, see
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2829.txt/[RFC-2829] and http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2251.txt/[RFC-2251].


SASL Realm:: The Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) realm used to connect to the LDAP server. It is
only available if the authentication method is Digest-MD5 or CRAM-MD5.

Username or DN:: Username or Distinguished Name DN of an LDAP user with read access to all necessary users and
groups. It is used to connect to the LDAP server.

Password:: Password for the Username or DN configured above.

To test your connection to the external LDAP server, click 'Verify connection'. A successful connection is
confirmed with notification pop up.

The connection details can be further refined by configuring timeout period, retry period and number of connection
attempts in 'Connection rules'.

Click 'Next' to proceed to configure <<ldap-sect-usergroup,user and group mappings>> for the LDAP configuration.

<<fig-create-ldap-connection>> shows a LDAP connection configuration for the repository manager configured to
connect to an LDAP server running on localhost port 10389 using the search base of `ou=system`.

[[fig-create-ldap-connection]]
.Create LDAP Connection
image::figs/web/ldap-create-connection.png[scale=50]

[[ldap-sect-usergroup]]
==== User and Group Mapping

The LDAP connection panel contains a section to manage 'User and group' mappings. This configuration is the next
step after you configure and verify the LDAP 'Connection'. It is separate panel called 'Choose Users and
Groups'.

This panel provides a 'Configuration template' drop-down, shown in <<fig-configuration-template>>. Based on your
template selection the rest of the field inputs will adjust to the appropriate user and group template
requirements. These templates are suggestions for typical configurations used on servers such as 'Active
Directory', 'Generic Ldap Server', 'Posix with Dynamic Groups' and 'Posix with Static Groups'. The values are
suggestions only and have to be adjusted to your specific needs based on your LDAP server configuration.

[[fig-configuration-template]]
.Configuration Template for Users and Groups
image::figs/web/ldap-configuration-template.png[scale=50]

The following parameters allow you to configure your user and group elements with the repository manager:

Base DN:: Corresponds to the collection of distinguished names used as the base for user entries. This DN is
relative to the Search Base. For example, if your users are all contained in +ou=users,dc=sonatype,dc=com+ and 
you specified a Search Base of +dc=sonatype,dc=com+, you use a value of +ou=users+.

User subtree:: Check the box if 'True'. Uncheck if 'False'. Values are 'True' if there is a tree below the Base 
DN that can contain user entries and 'False' if all users are contain within the specified Base DN. For example, 
if all users are in `ou=users,dc=sonatype,dc=com` this field should be 'False'. If users can appear in 
organizational units within organizational units such as `ou=development,ou=users,dc=sonatype,dc=com`, this field 
should be 'True'.

Object class:: This value is a standard object class defined in http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2798.html/[RFC-2798].
and specifies the object class for users. Common values are `inetOrgPerson`, `person`, `user` or `posixAccount`.

User filter:: This allows you to configure a filter to limit the search for user records. It can be used as a
performance improvement.

User ID attribute:: This is the attribute of the object class specified above, that supplies the identier for the
user from the LDAP server. The repository manager uses this attribute as the 'User ID' value.

Real name attribute:: This is the attribute of the Object class that supplies the real name of the user. The
repository manager uses this attribute when it needs to display the real name of a user similar to usage of the
internal 'First name' and 'Last name' attributes.

Email attribute:: This is the attribute of the Object class that supplies the email address of the user. The
repository manager uses this attribute for the 'Email' attribute of the user. It is used for email notifications
of the user.

Password attribute:: It can be used to configure the Object class, which supplies the password ("userPassword").
If this field is blank the user will be authenticated against a bind with the LDAP server. The password attribute 
is optional. When not configured authentication will occur as a bind to the LDAP server.  Otherwise this is the
attribute of the Object class that supplies the password of the user. The repository manager uses this attribute
when it is authenticating a user against an LDAP server.

An automatically checked box will allow you to 'Map LDAP groups as roles'. With the configuration any LDAP group
configured for a specific users is used to query the roles in the repository manager. Identical names trigger the
user to be granted the privileges of the roles.

Groups in LDAP systems are configured to be dynamic or static. A dynamic group is a list of groups to which users
belong. A static group contains a list of users. Select 'Dynamic Groups' or 'Static Groups' from the 'Group type'
drop-down to proceed with the appropriate configuration.

[[fig-group-element-mapping-static.png]]
.Static Group Element Mapping
image::figs/web/ldap-group-element-mapping-static.png[scale=50]

Static groups with an example displayed in <<fig-group-element-mapping-static.png>>, are configured with the
following parameters:

Group Base DN:: This field is similar to the 'Base DN' field described for User Element Mapping, but applies to
groups instead of users. For example, if your groups were defined under +ou=groups,dc=sonatype,dc=com+, this field
would have a value of +ou=groups+.

Group subtree:: This field is similar to the 'User subtree' field described for User Element Mapping, but
configures groups instead of users. If all groups are defined under the entry defined in Base DN, set the field to
false. If a group can be defined in a tree of organizational units under the Base DN, set the field to true.

Group object class:: This value in this field is a standard object class defined in
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2307.html/[RFC-2307]. The class is simply a collection of references to unique entries
in an LDAP directory and can be used to associate user entries with a group. Examples are `groupOfUniqueNames`,
`posixGroup` or custom values.

Group ID attribute:: Specifies the attribute of the object class that specifies the group identifier. If the value
of this field corresponds to the ID of a role, members of this group will have the corresponding privileges.

Group member attribute:: Specifies the attribute of the object class which specifies a member of a group. An
example value is 'uniqueMember'.

Group member format:: This field captures the format of the Group Member Attribute, and is used by the repository 
manager to extract a username from this attribute. An example values is `${dn}`.

If your installation does not use static groups, you can configure the LDAP connection to refer to an attribute 
on the user entry to derive group membership. To do this, select 'Dynamic Groups' in the 'Group type' drop down.

[[fig-dynamic-group-type.png]]
.Dynamic Group Element Mapping
image::figs/web/ldap-group-element-mapping-dynamic.png[scale=50]

Dynamic groups are configured via the 'Group member of attribute' parameter. The repository manager inspects this 
attribute of the user entry to get a list of groups of which the user is a member. In this configuration, seen in 
<<fig-dynamic-group-type.png>>, a user entry would have an attribute that would contain the name of a 
group, such as 'memberOf'.

Once you have configured the user and group settings on the 'Choose Users and Groups' form, you can check the
correctness of your user mapping by pressing the 'Verify user mapping' button. A successful mapping will result in
the retrieval of a list of user records, which will be shown in the 'User Mapping Test Result' dialog.

The repository manager provides you with the ability to test a user login directly. To test a user login, go to 
the 'Choose Users and Groups' page after all appropriate field inputs of the form are filled. Scroll to the 
bottom and click the 'Verify login' button.

The 'Verify login' button can be used to check if authentication and user/group mappings work as expected for a
specific user account besides the global account used for the LDAP configuration.

After your LDAP the successful configuration of your connection and user and group mappings, you can proceed to
configure external role mappings. This allows you to define the repository manager specific security for a LDAP
group. More details are available in <<roles>>.
	
[[user-token]]
=== Security Setup with User Tokens

{inrmonly}

[[user-token-intro]]
==== Introduction

When using Apache Maven with {pro}, the user credentials for accessing the repository manager have to be 
stored in the user’s `settings.xml` file. Like a `pom.xml` your `settings.xml` is file that contains your user 
preferences. The Maven framework has the ability to encrypt passwords within the +setting.xml+, but the need for 
it to be reversible in order to be used limits its security.

The default location of settings file is `~/.m2/settings.xml`. This file contains listings for personalized 
client or build-tool configurations such as repositories. This file is not exclusive to Maven-specific 
repositories.

Other build systems use similar approaches and can benefit from the usage of user tokens as well. {pro}'s user 
token feature establishes a two-part token for the user. Usage of the token acts as a substitute method for 
authentication that would normally require passing your username and password in plain text.

This is especially useful for scenarios where single sign-on solutions like LDAP are used for authentication
against the repository manager and other systems and the plain text username and password cannot be stored in the
`settings.xml` following security policies. In this scenario the generated user tokens can be used instead.

[[enable-reset-token]]
==== Enabling and Resetting User Tokens

User token-based authentication can be activated by an administrator or user with the +nx-usertoken-settings+ 
privilege. Users with that privilege must click the 'User Token' menu item under 'Security' in the 
'Administration' menu. Check the 'Enable user tokens' box, then press 'Save' to activate the feature.

Additionally, you can check the 'Require user tokens for repository authentication' box to allow the repository 
manager to require a user token for any access to the repository and group content URLs. This affects read and 
write access for deployments from a build execution or a manual upload, but the user interface will not change.

You can also reset the token of an individual user by selecting the 'User Token' tab in the 'Users' 
administration from the 'Security' menu. The password requested for the action to proceed is the password for the 
authenticated administrator who resets the token(s).

WARNING: Resetting user tokens forces users to update the `settings.xml` with the newly created tokens, and 
could potentially break any command line builds using the tokens until this change is carried out. This also 
applies to continuous integration servers using user tokens or any other automated build executions.

[[user-token-realms]]
==== Accessing User Tokens in Realms

When you activate user tokens, the feature automatically adds the 'User Token Realm' to the 'Active Realms' 
list. To see the results, go to 'Realms' located under 'Security' in the 'Administration' menu. If desired, you 
can re-order the security realms used, although the default settings with the 'User Token Realm' as the first 
realm is probably the desired setup. This realm is not removed when the user tokens are disabled; however, 
it will cleanly pass through to the next realm. The realm will remain in the active bin in your 'Realms' in case 
the feature is reactivated at a later stage.

[[access-token]]
==== Accessing and Using Your User Token

To grant users the ability to access user tokens:

1. Select 'Roles' from 'Security' in the 'Administration' menu.
2. Choose a role you want to assign the permission, from the selection panel.
3. Assign the 'nx-usertoken-current' privilege to the role, then save the change.

When enabled, the user can access their individual token from the mode toggle. To access the menu select the
username, on the top right area of the main toolbar. In the 'User' menu, to the left, the user will see the
'User Token' menu item.

In order to see the 'User Token' click the 'Access user token' button. This will prompt the 'Authenticate' dialog 
where you are required to re-enter your credentials. After clicking 'Authenticate' in the completed dialog, 
another dialog will appear with the user token.

Below the 'Access your token' section is another section that allows you to reset your token. Click the 'Reset 
user token' button, which prompts an 'Authenticate' dialog. Enter your credentials to complete the user 
token reset. Resetting the token will show a dialog with a success message, but you must access the user token 
again to see the new value.

The 'User Token' dialog displays user code and pass code tokens in separate fields. Below the token, is the 
server section of your +settings.xml+. When using the server section you can replace the `${server}` placeholder 
with the repository id that references your repository manager you want to authenticate against with the user 
token. The dialog will close automatically after one minute or simply click the 'Close' button.

The user code and pass code values can be used as replacements for username and password in the login dialog. 
You can still to use the original username and the pass code to log in to the user interface.

In order to utilize your user tokens for repository authentication you must access the repository manager with 
the user token, from the command line. For example, your username-password credentials access with

----
curl -v --user admin:admin123 http://localhost:2468/repository/bower-all/
----

can be replaced with the usage of user code and pass code separated by colon in the curl command line like this

----
curl -v --user N+ZBiTlF:76xSi+HAQvYHZH8kgyJldWD7aJnPgCrHG/Zu7mkpWmZZ http://localhost:2468/repository/bower-all/
----

////
Commented out because uncertain this feature exists in the app yet
User token values can be accessed as part of the Maven settings template feature automating updates as mentioned 
in <<maven-sect-single-group>>.

=== Authentication via Remote User Token
{inall}

The repository manager allows integration with external security systems that can pass along authentication of a
user via the +Remote_User+ HTTP header field for all requests - Remote User Token 'Rut' authentication. This
typically affects all web application usage in a web browser.

These are either web-based container or server-level authentication systems like
http://shibboleth.net/[Shibboleth]. In many cases, this is achieved via a server like
http://httpd.apache.org/[Apache HTTPD] or http://nginx.org/[nginx] proxying the repository manager. These servers
can in turn defer to other authentication storage systems e.g., via the http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/[Kerberos]
network authentication protocol. These systems and setups can be described as Central Authentication Systems CAS
or Single Sign On SSO.

From the users perspective, he/she is required to login into the environment in a central login page that then
propagates the login status via HTTP headers. the repository manager simply receives the fact that a specific user
is logged in by receiving the username in a HTTP header field.

The HTTP header integration can be activated by adding and enabling the 'Rut Auth' capability as documented in
<<admin-system-capabilities>> and setting the 'HTTP Header name' to the header populated by your security
system. Typically, this value is `REMOTE_USER`, but any arbitrary value can be set. An enabled capability 
automatically
causes the 'Rut Auth Realm' to be added to the 'Active' realms in the 'Realms' configuration described in 
<<realms>>.

When an external system passes a value through the header, authentication will be granted and the value will be
used as the user name for configured authorization scheme. For example, on a default installation with the
internal authorization scheme enabled, a value of 'admin' would grant the user the access rights in the user
interface as the 'admin' user.

A seamless integration can be set up for users if the external security system is exposed via LDAP and configured
in the repository manager as LDAP authorization realm combined with external role mappings and in parallel the
sign-on is integrated with the operating system sign-on for the user.

[[ssl]]
=== Configuring SSL

Using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) communication with the repository manager is an important security feature and a
recommended best practice. Secure communication can be inbound or outbound.

Outbound client communication may include integration with

* a remote proxy repository over HTTPS - documented in <<admin-repositories>>
* SSL/TLS secured servers - e.g. for SMTP/email integration documented in <<admin-system-emailserver>>
* LDAP servers configured to use LDAPS
* specialized authentication realms such as the Crowd realm.

Inbound client communication includes

* web browser HTTPS access to the user interface,
* tool access to repository content,
* and manual or scripted usage of the REST APIs.

[[ssl-proxy-repo]]
==== Outbound SSL - Trusting SSL Certificates of Remote Repositories

{inall}

When the SSL certificate of a remote proxy repository is not trusted, the repository may be automatically blocked 
outbound requests fail with a message similar to 'PKIX path building failed'.

The 'Proxy' configuration for each proxy repository documented in <<admin-repository-repositories>> includes a 
section titled 'Use the Nexus truststore'. It allows you to manage the SSL certificate of the remote repository 
and solves these problems. It is only displayed, if the remote storage uses a HTTPS URL.

The 'View certificate' button triggers the display of the SSL 'Certificate Details' dialog. An example is shown in
<<fig-ssl-certificate-details-dialog>>.

[[fig-ssl-certificate-details-dialog]]
.Certificate Details Dialog to Add an SSL to the Nexus Truststore
image::figs/web/ssl-certificate-details-dialog.png[scale=50]

Use the 'Certificate Details' dialog when the remote certificate is not issued by a well-known public certificate
authority included in the default Java trust store. This specifically also includes usage of self-signed 
certificates used in your organization. To confirm trust of the remote certificate, click the 'Add certificate to 
truststore' button in the dialog.  This feature is analogous to going to the <<fig-ssl-certificates-list, SSL 
Certificates>> user interface and using the 'Load certificate' button found there as described in 
<<ssl-certificates>>. If the certificate is already added, the button can undo this operation and will read 
'Remove certificate from trust store'.

The checkbox labelled 'Use certificates stored in Nexus to connect to external systems' is used to confirm that
the repository manager should consult the internal truststore as well as the JVM truststore when confirming trust
of the remote repository certificate. Without adding the certificate to the private truststore and enabling the
checkbox, the repository will not trust the remote.

The default JVM truststore of the JVM installation used to run the repository manager and the private truststores
are merged. The result of this merge is used to decide about the trust of the remote server. The default Java
truststore already contains public certificate authority trust certificates. If the remote certificate is signed
by one of these authorities, then explicitly trusting the remote certificate will not be needed.

WARNING: When removing a remote trusted certificate from the truststore, a repository manager restart is required
before a repository may become untrusted.

[[ssl-certificates]]
==== Outbound SSL - Trusting SSL Certificates Globally

{inall}

The repository manager allows you to manage trust of all remote SSL certificates in a centralized user
interface. Use this interface when you wish to examine all the currently trusted certificates for remote
repositories, or manage certificates from secure remotes that are not repositories.

Access <<fig-ssl-certificates-list, the feature view for SSL Certificates administration>> by selecting the 'SSL
Certificates' menu items in the 'Security' submenu in the 'Administration' main menu.

[[fig-ssl-certificates-list]]
.SSL Certificates Administration
image::figs/web/ssl-certificates-list.png[scale=50]

The list shows any certificates that are already trusted. Clicking on an individual row allows you to inspect the
certificate.  This detail view shows further information about the certificate including 'Subject', 'Issuer' and
'Certificate' details. The 'Delete certificate' button allows you to remove a certificate from the truststore.

The button 'Load certificate' above the list of certificates can be used to add a new certificate to the 
truststore by loading it directly from a server or using a PEM file representing the certificate.

The common approach is to choose 'Load from server' and enter the full +https://+ URL of the remote site, e.g,
`https://repo1.maven.org`. The repository manager will connect using HTTPS and use the HTTP proxy server settings
if applicable. When the remote is not accessible using +https://+, only enter the host name or IP address,
optionally followed by colon and the port number. For example: +example.com:8443+ . In this case the repository
manager will attempt a direct SSL socket connection to the remote host at the specified port. This allows you to
load certificates from SMTP or LDAP servers, if you use the correct port.

Alternatively you can choose the 'Paste PEM' option to configure trust of a remote certificate. Copy and paste the
Base64 encoded X.509 DER certificate to trust. This text must be enclosed between lines containing `-----BEGIN
CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` .

Typically this file is supplied to you by the certificate owner. An example method to get the encoded X.509 
certificate into a file on the command line using +keytool+ is:

----
keytool -printcert -rfc -sslserver repo1.maven.org > repo1.pem
----

The resulting `repo1.pem` file contains the encoded certificate text that you can cut and paste into the dialog in
the user interface. An example of inserting such a certificate is shown in <<fig-ssl-pem>>.

[[fig-ssl-pem]]
.Providing a Certificate in PEM Format
image::figs/web/ssl-pem.png[scale=50]

If the repository manager can successfully retrieve the remote certificate or decode the pasted certificate, the
details will be shown allowing you to confirm details as shown in <<fig-ssl-add-server>>. Please review the
displayed information carefully before clicking 'Add Certificate' to establish the truststore addition.

[[fig-ssl-add-server]]
.Certificate Details Displayed after Successful Retrieval or Parsing
image::figs/web/ssl-add-server.png[scale=50]

In some organizations, all of the remote sites are accessed through a globally configured proxy server which 
rewrites every SSL certificate. This single proxy server is acting as a private certificate authority. In this 
case, you can https://support.sonatype.com/entries/83303437[follow special instructions for trusting the proxy 
server root certificate], which can greatly simplify your certificate management duties.

==== Outbound SSL - Trusting SSL Certificates Using Keytool

{inall}

Managing trusted SSL certificates from the command line using
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/index.html#security[keytool] and system properties is an
alternative and more complex option than using the SSL certificate management features of the repository manager.

Before you begin the process of trusting a certificate from the command line you will need:

* a basic understanding of 
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html[SSL
  certificate technology and how the Java VM implements this feature]

* command line access to the host operating system and the 'keytool' program

* network access to the remote SSL server you want to trust from the host running the repository manager. This
  must include any HTTP proxy server connection details.

If you are connecting to servers that have certificates which are not signed by a public CA, you will need to 
complete these steps:

. Copy the default JVM truststore file (`$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts`) to a specific location for editing.

. Import additional trusted certificates into the copied truststore file.

. Configure JSSE system properties for the repository manager process so that the custom truststore is consulted
  instead of the default file.

Some common commands to manually trust remote certificates can be found in our
https://sonatype.zendesk.com/entries/95353268-SSL-Certificate-Guide#common-keytool-commands[SSL Certificate 
Guide].

After you have imported your trusted certificates into a truststore file, you can add the JVM parameters 
configuring the truststore file location and password as separate configuration lines into the file 
`$install-dir/etc/karaf/system.properties`.
----
javax.net.ssl.trustStore=<truststore>
javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<truststore_password>
----

Once you have added the properties shown above, restart the repository manager and attempt to proxy a remote
repository using the imported certificate. The repository manager will automatically register the certificates in
the truststore file as trusted.

[[ssl-inbound]]
==== Inbound SSL - Configuring to Serve Content via HTTPS

{inall}

Providing access to the user interface and content via HTTPS is a best practice.

You have two options:

* Using a separate reverse proxy server in front of the repository manager to manage HTTPS
* Configure the repository manager itself to serve HTTPS directly

===== Using A Reverse Proxy Server

A common approach is to access the repository manager through a dedicated server which answers HTTPS requests on
behalf of the repository manager - these servers are called reverse proxies or SSL/TLS terminators. Subsequently
requests are forwarded to the repository manager via HTTP and responses received via HTTP are then sent back to
the requestor via HTTPS.

There are a few advantages to using these which can be discussed with your networking team. For example, the
repository manager can be upgraded/installed without the need to work with a custom JVM keystore. The reverse
proxy could already be in place for other systems in your network. Common reverse proxy choices are Apache httpd,
nginx, Eclipse Jetty or even dedicated hardware appliances. All of them can be configured to serve SSL content,
and there is a large amount of reference material available online.

////
TBD - add link to reverse proxy setup doc once its done
////

.Serving SSL Directly

The second approach is to use the Eclipse Jetty instance that is distributed with the repository manager to accept
HTTPS connections.

[[enable-https]]
===== How to Enable the HTTPS Connector

. Create a Java keystore file at `$install-dir/etc/ssl/keystore.jks` which contains the Jetty SSL certificate
  to use.  Instructions are available on the
  http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/9.3.x/configuring-ssl.html[Eclipse Jetty documentation site].

. Edit `$data-dir/etc/nexus.properties`. Add a property on a new line `application-port-ssl=8443`. Change
  `8443` to be your preferred port on which to expose the HTTPS connector.

. Edit `$data-dir/etc/nexus.properties`. Change the `nexus-args` property comma delimited value to 
include `${jetty.etc}/jetty-https.xml`. Save the file.

. Restart Nexus. Verify HTTPS connections can be established.

. Update the `Base URL` to use `https` in your repository manager configuration using the
<<admin-system-capabilities, Base URL capability>>.

TIP: This configuration process is available link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzcvU802Az8[as a video
demonstration].

[[enable-redirect-to-https]]
===== How to Redirect All Plain HTTP Requests to HTTPS

Some organizations need to remind their users that Nexus should only be used over HTTPS - redirecting HTTP
requests to HTTPS can help.

. Follow all the steps under <<enable-https,How to Enable the HTTPS Connector>>. Make sure the `nexus-args`
  property value still includes the reference to `${jetty.etc}/jetty-http.xml`

. Edit `$data-dir/etc/nexus.properties`. Change the `nexus-args` property comma delimited value to include
  `${jetty.etc}/jetty-http-redirect-to-https.xml`. Save the file.

. Restart Nexus. Verify all plain HTTP requests get redirected to the equivalent HTTPS url.

TIP: Redirecting HTTP requests is not recommended because it introduces implied security and creates increased
network latency. Clients which send Basic Authorization headers preemptively may unintentionally expose
credentials in plain text.

[[disable-http]]
===== How to Disable the HTTP Connector

. Edit `$data-dir/etc/nexus.properties`. Change the `nexus-args` property comma delimited value to not
  include `${jetty.etc}/jetty-http.xml`. Save the file.

. Restart Nexus. Verify plain HTTP requests are no longer serviced.

[[auditing]]
=== Auditing

Auditing of {nxrm} is done by enabling a capability called 'Audit' as described in <<admin-system-capabilities>>. 
For your convenience, this capability is created by default in {nxrm} installations but is disabled.

Once enabled, a left navigation item 'Audit' will appear under the 'System' submenu of the 'Administration' 
section. Clicking on this item reveals a table of audit records that have occurred in your {nxrm} instance, like 
the example shown in <<audit-table-example>>. This table data persists through server restart but can be 
manually cleared using the 'Clear' button above the table results.

[[audit-table-example]]
.Example of 'Audit' Table with Expanded Line Item
image::figs/web/audit-table-example.png[scale=70]

The table contains a record for every configuration change, as well as any asset or component additions and 
removals. Each row will give you some details about the event, including the type of event, when it happened 
and which user initiated the action. In addition to what is shown, each line item can be expanded to show more 
information by clicking the `+` sign at the beginning of the row. The content of the expanded information 
varies slightly by the 'Domain' viewed. You can collapse the additional information by clicking the `-` sign at 
the beginning of the row. The table displays about 250 rows and if there are more than that you need to use 
pagination to see more entries.
