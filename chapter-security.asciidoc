Nexus uses role-based access control that gives administrators
very fine-grained control over user rights to 

* read from a repository or a subset of repositories,
* administer the Nexus server or parts of the Nexus configuration,
* access specific parts of the user interface,
* deploy to repositories or even just specific sections of a repository.

The default configuration of Nexus ships with roles and users with a
standard set of permissions. As your security requirements evolve,
you will likely need to customize security settings to create protected
repositories for multiple departments or development groups. Nexus
provides a security model that can adapt to any scenario. 

This chapter covers all aspects of security with Nexus including

* user account and access right management related to Nexus user
  interface as well as to component access documented in
  <<privileges>>, <<roles>> and <<users>>,
* selection of security backend systems documented <<realms>>
  including the built-in system as well as LDAP,
////
, Atlassian Crowd and others
////
* management of SSL certificates from remote repositories, SMTP and
  LDAP servers.
////
 documented in <<ssl>>.
////

////
TBD add more as applicable
////

Security-related configuration can be performed with the feature views
available via the 'Security' section of the 'Administration' main
menu. Many of the features shown in this section are only available to
users with the necessary privileges to access them.

Nexus' role-based access control system is backed by different
authentication and authorizations systems as documented in <<realms>>
and designed around the following security concepts:

Privileges:: <<privileges, Privileges>> are rights to read, update,
create, or manage resources and perform operations related to the
Nexus user interface as well as the components managed by Nexus in the
various repositories. Nexus ships with a set of core privileges that
cannot be modified.
////
 and you can create new privileges to allow for
fine-grained targeting of role and user permissions for specific
repositories.
////

Roles:: Privileges can be grouped into collections called <<roles,
roles>> to make it easier to define privileges common to certain
classes of users. For example, administrative users will all have
similar sets of permissions. Instead of assigning individual
privileges to individual users, you use roles to make it easier to
manage users with similar sets of privileges. A role has one or more
privileges and/or one or more roles.

Users:: <<users, Users>> can be assigned one or more roles, and model the
individuals who will be logging into Nexus and read, deploy, or
manage repositories as well as connect from client tools such at
Apache Maven.

////
Targets:: Privileges are usually associated with resources or
targets. In the case of Nexus, a target can be a specific repository
or a set of repositories grouped in something called a repository
target. A target can also be a subset of a repository or a specific
asset classes within a repository. Using a target you can apply a
specific privilege to a single groupId.
////

[[realms]]
=== Realms

The feature view for security realms administration displayed in
<<fig-realms>> allows you to activate and prioritize security realms
used for authentication and authorization by adding them to the
'Active' list on the right and placing them higher or lower on the
list.

[[fig-realms]]
.Security Realms Administration
image::figs/web/realms.png[scale=60]

Effectively, this configuration determines what authentication realm is
used to grant a user access and the order the realms are used.

Nexus Authenticating Realm and Nexus Authorizing Realm:: These are the
built-in realms used by default and allow Nexus to manage
security setup without additional external systems.

LDAP Realm:: This realm identifies external storage in an LDAP system
including e.g., Microsoft ActiveDirectory, ApacheDS, OpenLDAP and many
others.
////
 with details documented in
<<ldap>>.
////

////
Crowd Realm:: This realm identifies external storage in an Atlassian
Crowd system.

 with details documented in <<crowd>>.
////

Rut Auth Realm:: This realm uses an external authentication in any system
with the user authorization passed to Nexus in a HTTP header field
with details documented in <<remote-user-token>>.

////
The 'User Token Realm' is required for user token support 
documented in <<config-sect-usertoken>> and 
////

NuGet API-Key Realm:: This realm is required for deployments to
nuget-format repositories as documented in <<nuget>>.

[[privileges]]
=== Privileges

You can access the configuration of privileges via the 'Privileges'
menu item in the 'Security' submenu in the 'Administration' main menu.

Nexus use a number of types of privileges: 

application:: privileges related to the Nexus user interface and
related functionality.
repository-admin:: privileges related to the administration and
configuration of a specific repository separated into access to '*'
(all), 'add', 'browse', 'delete', 'edit' and 'read'.
repository-view:: privileges controlling access to the content of a
specific repository separate into access to '*' (all), 'add',
'browse', 'delete', 'edit' and 'read'.

Both 'repository-admin' as well as 'repository-view' privileges are
automatically created and deleted by Nexus, when repositories are
created or deleted.

The list of privileges displayed in <<fig-privileges-list>> displays
an icon for the privilege 'type' as the first column and then adds:

Name:: the Nexus internal identifier for the privilege

Description:: a human readable description of the purpose of the
privilege

Type:: the aspect of Nexus to which this privilege applies

Permission:: the Nexus internal permission definition as used by the
embedded security framework

Further details are available after pressing on a specific row in the
detail view.

[[fig-privileges-list]]
.List of Security Privileges
image::figs/web/privileges-list.png[scale=60]

////
To create a new privilege, click on the 'Add...' button in the
'Privileges' panel and choose 'Repository Target Privilege'. Creating a
privilege will load the New Repository Target Privilege form shown in
<<fig-configuring-new-privilege>>. This form takes a privilege name, a
privilege description, the repository to target, and a repository
target.

[[fig-configuring-new-privilege]]
.Creating a New Repository Target Privilege

Once you create a new privilege, it will create four underlying
privileges: create, delete, read, and update. The four privileges
created by the form in <<fig-configuring-new-privilege>>
are shown in <<fig-configuring-new-privileges>>.

[[repository-targets]]
=== Repository Targets

A 'Repository Target' is a set of regular expressions to match on the
path of components in a repository (in the same way as the routing
rules work). Nexus is preconfigured with a number of repository
targets and allows you to create additional ones. Access the
management interface visible in <<fig-config-repo-target-mgt>> via
the 'Repository Targets' menu item in the left-hand 'Views/Repositories'
sub menu.


[[fig-config-repo-target-mgt]]
.Managing Repository Targets
image::figs/web/repository-manager_repository-targets.png[scale=60]

Repository targets allow you to define, for example, a target called
Apache Maven with a pattern of `^/org/apache/maven/.*`. This would
match all components with a groupId of 'org.apache.maven' and any
components within nested groupIds like 'org.apache.maven.plugins'.

A pattern that would capture more components like all components with
any part of the path containing 'maven' could be `.*maven.*`.

The regular expressions can also be used to exclude components as
visible with the pattern `(?!.*-sources.*).*` in
<<fig-config-repo-target-exclude>> where components with the qualifier
'-sources' are excluded. The syntax used for the expressions is the
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/[Java syntax],
that is similar but not identical to the Perl syntax.

[[fig-config-repo-target-exclude]]
.Excluding Source Artifacts from a Repository Targets
image::figs/web/repository-manager_repository-targets-2.png[scale=60]

By combining multiple patterns in a repository target, you can
establish a fine-grained control of components included and excluded.

Once you have created a repository target, you can it as part of your
security setup.  You can add a new privilege that relates to the
target and controls the CRUD operations for components matching that
path. The privilege can even span multiple repositories. With this
setup you can delegate all control of components in 'org.apache.maven'
to a "Maven" team. In this way, you don't need to create separate
repositories for each logical division of your components.

Repository targets are also be used for matching components for
implicit capture in the Staging Suite as documented in <<staging>>.
////

[[roles]]
=== Roles

Roles aggregate privileges into a related context and can, in turn, be
grouped to create more complex roles.

Nexus ships with a predefined 'admin' as well as an
'anonymous' role. These can be inspected in the 'Roles' feature view
accessible via the 'Roles' item in the 'Security' section of the
'Administration' main menu. A simple example is shown in
<<fig-roles-list>>. The list displays the 'Name' an
'Description' of the role as well as the 'Source', which displays
whether the role is internal ('Nexus') or a mapping to an external
source like LDAP.

[[fig-roles-list]]
.Viewing the List of Defined Roles
image::figs/web/roles-list.png[scale=60]

To create a new role, click on the 'Create role' button, select 'Nexus
Role' and fill out the Role creation feature view shown in
<<fig-roles-create>>.

[[fig-roles-create]]
.Creating a New Role
image::figs/web/roles-create.png[scale=60]

When creating a new role, you will need to supply a 'Role ID' and a
'Name' and optionally a 'Description'. Roles are comprised of other
roles and individual privileges. To assign a role or privilege to a
role, drag and drop the desired privileges from the 'Available' list
to the 'Given' list under the 'Privileges' header. You can use the
'Filter' input to narrow down the list of displayed privileges and the
arrow buttons to add or remove privileges.

The same functionality is available under the 'Roles' header to
select among the 'Available' roles and add them to the list of
'Contained' roles.

Finally press the 'Create Role' button to get the role created. 

An existing role can be inspected and edited by clicking on the row in
the list. This role-specific view allows you to delete the role with
the 'Delete role' button. The built-in roles are managed by Nexus and
cannot be edited or deleted. The 'Settings' section displays the same
section as the creation view as displayed in <<fig-roles-create>>. .

In addition you can inspect the 'Privilege trace' as well as the 'Role
tree' view of the role displayed in <<fig-roles-tree>>. A role is
comprised of other roles and individual privileges. The 'Privilege
trace' view allows you to select a specific privilege and see a list of
roles that contain the privilege. The 'Role tree' view allows you to
browse through the tree list of roles and their nested roles and
privileges that comprise the role.

[[fig-roles-tree]]
.Viewing a Role Tree
image::figs/web/roles-tree.png[scale=60]

In addition to creating a Nexus role, the 'Create role' button allows
you to create an 'External role mapping' to an external authorization
system configured in Nexus such as 'LDAP'. This is something you would
do, if you want to grant every member of an externally managed group
(such as an LDAP group) a number of privileges and roles in Nexus. 

For example, assume that you have a group in LDAP named +scm+ and you
want to make sure that everyone in the +scm+ group has Nexus
administrative privileges.

Select 'External Role Mapping' and 'LDAP' to see a list of roles managed by that
external realm in a dialog. Pick the desired 'scm' group and confirm
by pressing 'Create mapping'.

Once the external role has been selected, creates a linked Nexus
role. You can then assign other roles and privileges to this new
externally mapped role like you would do for any other role.

Any user that is part of the 'scm' group in LDAP, receives all the
privileges defined in the created Nexus role allowing you to adapt
your generic role in LDAP to the Nexus-specific use cases you want
these users to be allowed to perform.

////
TIP: With the Repository Targets, you have fine-grained control over
every action in the system. For example, you could make a target that
includes everything except sources `(.*(?!-sources)\.*)` and assign that
to one role while giving yet another role access to everything. Using
these different access roles e.g., you can host your public and private
components in a single repository without giving up control of your
private components.
////

[[users]]
=== Users

Nexus ships with two users: 'admin' and 'anonymous'. The 'admin' user
has all privileges and the 'anonymous' user has read-only privileges.

The 'Users' feature view displayed in <<fig-users-list>> can be
accessed via the 'Users' item in the 'Security' section of the
'Administration' menu. The list shows the users 'User ID', 'First
Name', 'Last Name' and 'Email' as well as what security 'Realm' is
used and if the accounts 'Status' is 'active' or 'disabled'.

[[fig-users-list]]
.Feature View with List of Users
image::figs/web/users-list.png[scale=50]

Clicking on a user in the list or clicking on the 'Create user' button
displays the details view to edit or create the account shown in
<<fig-users-create>>. The 'ID' can be defined upon initial creation
and remains fixed thereafter. In addition you can specify the users
'First Name', 'Last Name' and 'Email' address. The 'Status' allows you
to set an account to be 'Disabled' or 'Active'.

The 'Roles' control allows you to add and remove defined <<roles,
roles>> to the user and therefore control the
<<privileges,privileges>> assigned to the user. A user can be assigned
one or more roles that in turn can include references to other roles
or to individual privileges. To view a tree of assigned Nexus roles
and privileges, press on the 'Role Tree' button.

[[fig-users-create]]
.Creating or Editing a User
image::figs/web/users-create.png[scale=60]

If you need to find out exactly how a particular user has been granted
a particular privilege, you can use the 'Privilege trace'
panel. Selecting a privilege in the left-side 'Privileges' column
causes all roles that contain the specific privilege in the 'Role
containment' column on the right. If a user has been assigned a
specific privilege by more than one Role or Privilege assignment, you
will be able to see this reflected in the 'Role Containment' list.

The 'More' button in the allows you to select the 'Change Password'
item in the drop down. The password can be changed in a dialog,
provided the user is managed by the built-in security realm.

[[anonymous]]
=== Anonymous Access

By default, the Nexus user interface as well as the repositories and
the contained components are available to unauthenticated users. The
'Anonymous' feature view is available via the 'Anonymous' item in the
'Security' section of the 'Administration' main menu and shown in
<<fig-anonymous>>.

The privileges available to these users are controlled by the roles
assigned to the 'anonymous' user from the 'NexusAuthorizingRole'. By
changing the privileges assigned to this user in the
<<users, Users feature view>>.

[[fig-anonymous]]
.Configuring Anonymous Access
image::figs/web/anonymous.png[scale=60]

If you want to disable unauthenticated access to Nexus entirely, you
can uncheck the 'Allow anonymous users to access the server'
checkbox. The 'Username' and 'Realm' controls allow you to change the
details for the anonymous user. E.g. you might have a 'guest' account
defined in your LDAP system and desire to use that user for
anonymous access.

////
[[user-token]]
=== Security Setup with User Tokens

==== Introduction

When using Apache Maven with Nexus, the user credentials for accessing
Nexus have to be stored in clear text in the user's settings.xml
file. Maven has the ability to encrypt passwords in setting.xml, but
the need for it to be reversible in order to be used, limits its
security. In addition, the general setup and use is cumbersome, and the
potential need for regular changes due to strong security requirements
e.g., with regular, required password changes triggers the need for a
simpler and more secure solution.

Other build systems use similar approaches and can benefit from the
usage of User Token as well.

The User Token feature of Nexus fills that need for Apache Maven as
well as other build systems and users. It introduces a two-part token
for the user, replacing the username and password with a user code and
a pass code that allows no way of recovering the username and password
from the user code and pass code values; yet can be used for
authentication with Nexus from the command line via Maven as well
as in the UI.

This is especially useful for scenarios where single sign-on solutions
like LDAP are used for authentication against Nexus and other systems
and the plain text username and password cannot be stored in the
+settings.xml+ following security policies. In this scenario the
generated user tokens can be used instead.

User token usage is integrated in the Maven settings template feature of Nexus
documented in <<settings>> to further simplify its use.

==== Enabling and Resetting User Tokens

The user token-based authentication can be activated by a Nexus
administrator or user with the role usertoken-admin or
usertoken-all by accessing the 'User Token' item in the 'Security' submenu on
the left-hand 'Nexus' menu.

Once user token is 'Enabled' by activating the checkbox in the
administration tab displayed in <<fig-config-user-token-main>> and
pressing 'Save',  the feature is activated and the additional section to
Reset All User Tokens is available as well.

[[fig-config-user-token-main]]
.User Token Administration Tab Panel
image::figs/web/config-user-token-main.png[scale=60]

Selecting the 'Protect Content' feature configures Nexus to require a
user token for any access to the content urls of Nexus that includes
all repositories and groups. This affects read access as well as write
access e.g., for deployments from a build execution or a manual upload.

'Activating User Token' as a feature automatically adds the 'User
Token Realm' as a 'Selected Realm' in the 'Security Settings' section as
displayed in <<fig-config-user-token-security-settings>> and available
in the 'Server' section of the left-hand 'Administration' menu. If
desired, you can reorder the security realms used, although the
default settings with the 'User Token Realm' as a first realm is
probably the desired setup. This realm is not removed when the User
Token feature is disabled; however, it will cleanly pass through to the
next realm and with the realm remaining any order changes stay
persisted in case the feature is reactivated at a later stage.


[[fig-config-user-token-security-settings]]
.Selected Realms Server Security Settings with User Token Realm activated
image::figs/web/config-user-token-security-settings.png[scale=60]

Besides resetting all user tokens, an administrator can reset the token
of an individual user by selecting the 'User Token' tab in the 'Users'
administration from the 'Security' menu in the left-hand navigation
displayed in <<fig-config-user-token-user-reset>>. The password
requested for this action to proceed is the password for the currently
logged in administrator resetting the token(s).

[[fig-config-user-token-user-reset]]
.User Token Reset for Specific User in Security Users Administration
image::figs/web/config-user-token-user-reset.png[scale=50]

WARNING: Resetting user tokens forces the users to update the
`settings.xml` with the newly created tokens and potentially breaks any
command line builds using the tokens until this change is
carried out. This specifically also applies to continuous integration
servers using user tokens or any other automated build executions.

==== Accessing and Using Your User Tokens

With user token enabled, any user can access his/her individual tokens via their
'Profile' panel. To access the panel, select 'Profile' when clicking on the
user name in the top right-hand corner of the Nexus user
interface. Then select 'User Token' in the drop-down to get access to the 'User
Token' screen in the 'Profile panel' displayed in
<<fig-config-user-token-profile>>.

[[fig-config-user-token-profile]]
.User Token Panel for the Logged in Users in the Profile Section
image::figs/web/config-user-token-profile.png[scale=50]

In order to be able to see this 'User Token' panel the user has to have
the +usertoken-basic+ role or the +usertoken-user+ privilege. To access or
reset the token you have to press the respective button in the panel
and then provide your username and password in the dialog.

Resetting the token will show and automatically hide a dialog with a
success message and accessing the token will show the dialog displayed
in <<fig-config-user-token-access>>.

[[fig-config-user-token-access]]
.Accessing the User Token Information
image::figs/web/config-user-token-access.png[scale=40]

The User Token dialog displays the user code and pass code tokens in
separate fields in the top level section as well as a server section
ready to be used in a Maven settings.xml file. When using the server
section you simply have to replace the `${server}` placeholder with
the repository id that references your Nexus server you want to
authenticate against with the user token.  The dialog will close
automatically after one minute or can be closed with the Close button.

The user code and pass code values can be used as replacements
for username and password in the login dialog for Nexus. It is also
possible to use the original username and the pass code to log in to
Nexus.

With content protection enabled, command line access to Nexus will
require the tokens to be supplied. Access to e.g., the releases
repository via

----
curl -v --user admin:admin http://localhost:9081/content/repositories/releases/
----

has to be replaced with the usage of user code and pass code separated
by colon in the curl command line like this

----
curl -v --user HdeHuL4x:Y7ZH6ixZFdOVwNpRhaOV+phBISmipsfwVxPRUH1gkV09 http://localhost:9081/content/repositories/releases/
----

User token values can be accessed as part of the Maven settings
template feature automating updates as documented in <<settings>>.

NOTE: The user tokens are created at first access whether that is by
using the Nexus user interface or the Nexus Maven Plugin.

==== Configuring User Token behaviour

The user token feature is preconfigured with built-in parameters and
no external configuration file is created by default. It is however
possible to customize some behaviour by creating a file
'sonatype-work/nexus/conf/usertoken.properties''.

The following properties can be configured:

According to Jason Dillon this is mostly for testing the underlying
mechanism and the super edge case when the default strategy incurs too
many name-code collisions, this is also not well tested so we remove
it for now (or ever)
usertoken.encodingStrategyProvider.strategy:: 	Define the
EncodingStrategy for the token with the default value being
'6-33-Base64' and '9-30-Base64' as optional alternative strategy.
similar to above, very advanced and should not be exposed to users at
this stage according to Jason Dillon
usertoken.userTokenServiceImpl.maximumUniqueNameCodeAttempts::
The maximum number of retries to find a unique name code, when
creating the token. Defaults to 10.

usertoken.userTokenServiceImpl.allowLookupByUserName:: This parameter controls
if username lookup is allowed when using a pass code. The default is
set to true. If set to false, user code and pass code have to be used
to authenticate, otherwise username and pass code is also
possible. This would be the more secure setting.
usertoken.userTokenServiceImpl.restrictByUserAgent:: With this value
set to true (the default), any access to the Nexus content
with content protection enabled will only be allowed to browser-based 
access even without credentials. Other tools like curl or wget
or other command-line tools will be blocked. With the more secure
setting of +false+, any access without correct codes will be
disallowed.

The 'usertoken.' prefix is optional when the properties are loaded
from the 'usertoken.properties' file.
////


[[remote-user-token]]
=== Authentication via Remote User Token

Nexus allows integration with external security systems that can pass
along authentication of a user via the +Remote_User+ HTTP header field
for all requests - Remote User Token 'Rut' authentication. This
typically affects all web application usage in a web browser.

These are either web-based container or server-level authentication
systems like http://shibboleth.net/[Shibboleth]. In many cases, this
is achieved via a server like http://httpd.apache.org/[Apache HTTPD]
or http://nginx.org/[nginx] proxying Nexus. These servers can in turn
defer to other authentication storage systems e.g., via the
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/[Kerberos] network authentication
protocol. These systems and setups can be described as Central
Authentication Systems CAS or Single Sign On SSO.

From the users perspective, he/she is required to login into the
environment in a central login page that then propagates the login
status via HTTP headers. Nexus simply receives the fact that a
specific user is logged in by receiving the username in a HTTP header
field.

The HTTP header integration can be activated by adding and enabling
the 'Rut Auth' capability as documented in <<capabilities>> and
setting the 'HTTP Header name' to the header populated by your
security system. Typically, this value is `REMOTE_USER`, but any
arbitrary value can be set. An enabled capability automatically causes
the 'Rut Auth Realm' to be added to the 'Active' realms in the
'Realms' configuration described in <<realms>>.

When an external system passes a value through the header,
authentication will be granted and the value will be used as the user
name for configured authorization scheme. For example, on a default
Nexus installation with the Nexus authorization scheme enabled, a
value of 'admin' would grant the user the access rights in the user
interface as the 'admin' user.

A seamless integration can be set up for users if the external
security system is exposed via LDAP and configured in Nexus as LDAP
authorization realm combined with external role mappings and in
parallel the sign-on is integrated with the operating system sign-on
for the user.
